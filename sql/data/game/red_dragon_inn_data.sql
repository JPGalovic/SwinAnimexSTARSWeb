		 "Adventuring is a hard life, with many trials and dangers. So let’s skip it and get to the good part, drinking away your hard earned loot in the tavern afterwards! Choose your adventurer, put up a chair and prepare to participate in the rowdiest celebration! Gamble and drink, but keep a wary eye open. Your ‘comrades’ will happily help themselves to your gold should your pass out from liquor and blunt force trauma, and the Wench will boot out anyone who can’t pay their tab. Good thing everyone has a few tricks up their sleave.",
