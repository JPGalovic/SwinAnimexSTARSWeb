Will you draw upon the Gods of Chaos and the Immaterium to augment your forces? Or will you stand as one of the Xenos races seeking to claim the galaxy. Warhammer 40,000 is the long running tabletop wargame about the grimmest future imaginable, billions fall and trillions more stand ready to replace them in a galaxy spanning war of conquest. Forget peace and prosperity, such notions are the currency of the dead.",
