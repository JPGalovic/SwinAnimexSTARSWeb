		 "Villages are sweet places, calm and quiet, nestled amongst farmlands and forests. And villagers are simple folk, full of hope and vigour. Of course that morning when they wake up and find that someone has been brutally murdered by werewolves, these wise folk know that the only way to stop them is to lynch them in human form. So get the ropes and figure out who’s the most suspicious person. Keep going and maybe one day, you’ll live free from the terror of werewolves once more.",
