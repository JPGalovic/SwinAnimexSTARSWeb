		 "From Kunihiko Ikuhara, the director of Sailor Moon and Revolutionary Girl Utena, comes a beautifully animated, allegorical tale of love, loss, and bear attacks - Yurikuma Arashi. 

		 In a world divided between humans and hyper-intelligent, man-eating bears, Kureha attends an all-girls school and holds onto a simple wish—to spend the rest of her life with her classmate and soul mate, Sumika. But after a secret rendezvous ends in tragedy, Kureha vows to never back down on her love and put a bullet in any bear she meets. 

		 As she plots her revenge, the bear-attack body count begins to rise and two strange girls transfer into Kureha&apos;s class. She doesn&apos;t know it yet, but the girls who call themselves Ginko and Lulu are actually criminal bears in disguise! As they try to win Kureha&apos;s heart , an army of high school girls gears up to go to war with all of bear-kind and anyone else who stands up for love. At this rate, getting the yuri seal of approval from an interdimensional tribunal of cool, beautiful, sexy judges is going to be the least of their troubles.",

		 "Never Back Down On Love",
		 "A long time ago, a far off planet known as Kumaria exploded, resulting in its shards falling upon Earth and causing the bears to attack the humans, resulting in a large wall being erected to separate them from the humans. In the present day, two bears, Ginko Yurishiro and Lulu Yurigasaki, disguise themselves as humans and enrol in Arashigaoka Academy, where Ginko takes an interest in a girl named Kureha Tsubaki, becoming jealous of her relationship with Sumika Izumino. When their favorite lily garden is butchered, the class president Mitsuko Yurizono offers to help Kureha and Sumika, who all become cautious when they are attacked by a brick out of nowhere. The next day, as Sumika mysteriously disappears, Kureha receives an anonymous call asking if her love for Sumika is real, leading Kureha to the rooftop where she is attacked by bears. Meanwhile, Ginko and Lulu undergo a &quot;yuri trial&quot; held by the mysterious Life Judgement Guys of Severance Court, who grant them &quot;yuri approval&quot;, in which they transform into half-bear half-human form and lick nectar from a lily flower growing from Kureha's chest. As Kureha recovers, wondering if what she saw was a dream, Mitsuko discovers Ginko and Lulu in their bear forms eating a girl behind the lily garden."

One day, however, Milne died after being stung by bees whilst trying to get more honey, which left Lulu unhappy despite getting what she wanted. Several years later, Ginko appeared before Lulu, bringing her the honey that Milne had previously tried to give her and reminding her not to forget what she has lost.
