		 "Hello! Commander!",
		 "Fubuki arrives at the naval base as a newcomer to the Third Torpedo Squadron, where she is introduced by Mutsuki to the rest of her squadron. After an abrupt meeting and exchange of greetings with Akagi of the First Carrier Division during her flight drills, Fubuki spends recreational time with her new squad-mates. Meanwhile, the Fourth Fleet locates the base of the enemy abyssal fleet, and the admiral orders a fleet assembled to commence an assault as the Fourth Fleet retreats. The First Carrier Task Force, Second Support Fleet and Third Torpedo Squadron are summarily sortied, however to the dismay of Fubuki's squadron, they learn that Fubuki has never engaged in battle before. The squadron encounters and engages a group of enemy destroyers, and just as Fubuki is close to being annihilated by one, the enemy group is destroyed by aircraft of the First Carrier Division. "

		 "Without Dissent, Without Shame, Without Resentment!",
		 "Fubuki has decided to become as strong as Akagi, so she can fight in the same fleet as her. Fubuki is then given a series of training sessions from other kanmusu; including but not limited to; balancing, target practice, and confidence boosting. Meanwhile, Akagi is having a target practice training session with Kaga supervising. During the school session, Ashigara punishes Yudachi for not doing her homework by giving her more homework. Ashigara then gives the destroyer a question about Type 93 Torpedoes only for Fubuki to whisper the answer in order to cheat, but Ashigara accepts the answer anyway. Ashigara then gives Fubuki a question about oxygen torpedoes, as the destroyer answers it correctly. Not long after school, after many attempts of balancing training from Sendai, Fubuki decided to talk to Akagi at the hot springs only to run into the recently-repaired Atago instead. Fubuki would later attempt to smile with Naka as her trainer, much to her embarrassment, as she would later be sleepless and get sleepy the next day. Fubuki would later continue her balancing training with Sendai as night falls. "

		 "The Operation to Capture W Island!",
		 "Fubuki's squadron, the Third Torpedo Squadron, and the Fourth Torpedo Squadron consisting of YÅ«bari, Kuma, Tama, Mochizuki, Yayoi, and Kisaragi are sent to an operation to defeat an enemy torpedo squadron residing in the W island by luring them out during night. Fubuki becomes nervous about the operation as she is still not confident in her abilities. However her friends cheer her up and wishes her good luck in the operation, and in the morning, Fubuki meets Akagi during morning practice. Akagi gives Fubuki some inspiring advice as a Kanmusu, letting Fubuki gain more confidence in herself. The Third and Fourth Torpedo Squadron are sent to the operation during daytime in order to do reconnaissance over the enemy fleet until night time to initiate their mission. However their operation is put on halt when two enemy Nu-class Light Aircraft Carriers discover the location of Fubuki's squadron, forcing them to retreat and run away from the enemy torpedo squadron who starts chasing after them, while facing several numbers of Abyssal enemy aircraft. Through the efforts of Fubuki's squadron, the Fourth Torpedo Squadron, and thanks to the reinforcements by the Second Fleet consisting of Kongo, Hiei, Haruna, and Kirishima, who had arrived after an expedition, the enemy torpedo squadron is forced to retreat and the enemy Nu-class Light Aircraft Carriers are defeated. However, Kisaragi is sunk by a bomber while patrolling alone. "

On the day of the mission, Fubuki and the others have to find a way to bring out Shimakaze, who is eventually lured in by a tea party. During the mission, Fubuki's concerns over Mutsuki starts to overwhelm her, but Kongo saves her and calms her down before finishing off the enemy fleet.

		 "Don't Compare Me to the Girls in Carrier Group Five!",
		 "The admiral announces a reorganization of the fleets, so Fubuki and the rest of the Third Torpedo Squardron spend their last night together to continue their spirit in whatever fleet they end up in. Fubuki ends up in the Fifth Mobile Fleet along with Kongo, Kitakami, Oi, Kaga, and Zuikaku, quickly discovering that the latter two don't get along with each other since they are from different Carrier Groups. As Fubuki laments her experience, she learns from Akagi that the splits were made to prepare the girls for a counterattack mission against the Abyssal. With the unit arguing over who should be the flagship, the girls take turns being the flagship, each one turning out to be a failure due to their own selfishness. Just as Zuikaku contemplates asking the admiral to reassign the groups, the unit is launched an attack on the Abyssal, with Fubuki calmly giving out orders before acting as a decoy, allowing the unit to defeat the enemy. Impressed by her ability to take command, the unit unanimously nominate Fubuki to be the flagship and start to get along with each other better. "

		 "Destroyer Division Six and the Battle of Curry Seas!",
		 "The annual curry contest is announced, with the winning curry recipe to be used on the official menu. The Sixth Destroyer Division, consisting of Akatsuki, Hibiki, Ikazuchi and Inazuma, hope to win the contest in order to become proper ladies, but none of them have made curry before. Despite running into various mishaps in their attempts to successfully make curry, the group nonetheless remain determined. On the day of the contest, most of the competing teams end up knocking themselves out, leaving just Division Six against Ashigara and Haguro, who prove to be intimidating opponents. After judging both entries, Nagato judges Division Six's mild curry as the winner, for the reason that she cannot handle spicy foods. "

		 "I Hate Carrier Group One!",
		 "During a skirmish against the Abyssal by Mobile Unit Five, Kaga gets damaged while protecting Zuikaku, who failed to notice a torpedo whilst trying to show Kaga up. With an important mission taking place the next day and no instant repairs available, Nagato assigns Shokaku to take Kaga's place while she undergoes repairs, also sharing with Fubuki some concerns the Admiral has had concerning the Abyssal. During the mission, Fubuki, having learned that the Abyssal may be aware of their codes, has Shokaku and Zuikaku send out recon planes to her suspicions after the main fleet is attacked and one girl is adrift due to hidden dive bombers. As Fubuki and the others engage and destroy one carrier fleet, Shokaku and Zuikaku find themselves caught in an ambush by another carrier group lying in wait, unable to send out additional planes or contact the others with Shokaku being badly damaged. Remembering Kaga's words, Zuikaku bets on the slim chance of hope by hiding in a nearby squall and manages to hold out until Fubuki and the others come to their aid and fend off the enemy, damaging the carrier and sinking the rest of its fleet, forcing it to retreat into the squall.

		 "I'm Not a Hotel!",
		 "Following their battle, Fubuki's group arrive at Truk Island where the base for Operation FS is located, where they meet a battleship named Yamato, who has never actually been out to sea. Recalling how she herself wasn't allowed into battle when she started out, Fubuki tries to get Yamato to go swimming with her, but is immediately shut down by Nagato. Later that night, Fubuki takes Yamato out in secret, but as soon as Yamato sets foot on the water, she becomes incredibly hungry. Nagato later explains that the reason Yamato isn't sent out is because of how much fuel and resources she consumes. After getting some inspiration from Mutsuki and Yudachi, Fubuki builds a raft so that they can take Yamato out onto the sea without using any of her resources. Along the way, they come across some airborne Abyssal, which Yamato manages to destroy with her weapons, earning some slight praise from Nagato. "

		 "Second Remodel-poi?!",
		 "Yudachi suddenly starts emitting a weird glow and is taken into the factory. When Fubuki and Mutsuki go to visit her, they discover Yudachi has been 'remodeled' into a completely different person with new equipment as a result of her experience. Later that night, Yudachi learns she is being transferred to Carrier Group One, while Fubuki is informed that Mobile Unit Five is being disbanded and she is being sent back to the Naval District. She is distraught, until she watches Yudachi training with her new gear and learns that the other destroyer girls have been looking up to Fubuki as a role-model and giving them the drive to work harder. While Fubuki and her escorts sail to the Naval District, a familiar Wo-class carrier sends out an attack wing of fighter/bombers to attack the base. While no ships are lost in the attack, the commander ends up missing as he stays behind to ensure everyone else is safe. After the fleet girls work together to rebuild the facility, Nagato announces that, per the Admiral's final orders before his disappearance, that Fubuki is to be remodeled. "

		 "Let's Do Our Best!",
		 "As Nagato and the other command girls try to determine from the Admiral's orders where the Abyssal base is, Fubuki ups her training in the hopes of gaining the necessary requirements to be remodeled, leaving Mutsuki downhearted as she gets to spend less time with her. When Fubuki and the reformed Third Torpedo Squadron encounter the Abyssal during a scouting mission, Fubuki rushes in hoping to increase her experience while taking heavy damage in the process, barely making it out alive. When she wakes up in the docks, she is scolded by Mutstuki, who does not want to lose her like Kisaragi. Later that night Fubuki finds her and apologizes, telling her about when she first met the commander and the words he told her shortly after she arrived which inspired her to pursue her own dream of helping everyone which is witnessed by Akagi and Kaga. The next day, as Akagi requests Fubuki to escort her during her next mission, but Kaga decides to test Fubuki to see if she is worthy by pitting her against their planes. Despite struggling a lot and taking severe damage, Fubuki receives encouragement from both Akagi and Mutsuki and passes the test earning the right to become remodeled, though her remodel isn't too different from her previous one &#40compared to Yudachi&#41. Afterwards Nagato declares MI base the next target for the fleets counterattack. "

Shortly afterwards Nagato announces the battle fleet, including Carrier Group One and Two, Kongo and Hiei, Fubuki, Yudachi, and Kitakami, is to meet Yamato and other ships to attack MI with a second fleet doing a feint on a smaller base. Fubuki, Yudachi and Mutsuki meet and promise to come back safely, while Mutsu tries to comfort Nagato, who is doubting the mission. As the mission begins, Akagi decides to leave Kongo and Fubuki to wait for the others while the carriers begin the attack. They discover an Airfield Princess and launch a surprise attack, severely damaging her, but as they get ready for the second wave, the one eyed Wo-class carrier launches its own surprise attack with two Nu-class carriers, several destroyers and a torpedo and light cruiser. With her bow destroyed and her teammates taking heavy damage, Akagi, feeling that she had failed to change fate, remains motionless as a bomber heads towards her. "
