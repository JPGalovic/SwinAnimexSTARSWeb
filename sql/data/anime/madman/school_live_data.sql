Although the antidote manages to cure Kurumi of her condition, Tarōmaru is left weak from being infected for so long and passes away in Miki's arms. After giving Tarōmaru a proper burial alongside Megumi, the girls learn that the reason he went down to the basement was to search for another puppy that was somewhere in the school. With the school no longer habitable due to the damage done to the electricity, the girls decide to head towards a university marked on a map by Megumi, holding a graduation ceremony to bid their farewells to the school. As the girls set off on their &quot;graduation trip&quot;, another girl elsewhere comes across one of their letters. "
