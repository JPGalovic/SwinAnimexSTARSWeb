		 "Yoshino &quot;Hideyoshi&quot; Hide is an average student who has to brush up on her history knowledge for a test in order to avoid summer classes. As she goes to a shrine to pray for her success, she spots a woman performing a strange ritual inside the shrine. When she is spotted, she clumsily stumbles towards the woman and they both disappear. When Hideyoshi comes to, she finds herself in a forest and discovers a blazing village, where a warrior resembling her friend Akemi is fighting against some vandals before a scantily-clad mysterious woman saves her. The two women take Hideyoshi back to their palace, where they introduce themselves as Oda Nobunaga and Akechi Mitsuhide, and become curious about the technology Hideyoshi has. With Hideyoshi seeming to think that she has warped to the Sengoku period, but with historical figures portrayed as women, Hideyoshi attempts to leave to find her way home, but gets lost and is retrieved by Nobunaga. Nobunaga reveals her ambition to gather the pieces of the Crimson Armor, and Hideyoshi innocently agrees to help her. Later, Hideyoshi is approached by a helmet-wearing white puppy named Shiro who, to her surprise, is somehow able to talk."
