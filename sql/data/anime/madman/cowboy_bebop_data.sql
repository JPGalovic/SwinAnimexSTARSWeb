		 "Asteroid Blues",
		 "In a flashback, Spike Spiegel is shown waiting near a church holding a bouquet of flowers, before leaving as the church bell rings. As he walks away, images of a gunfight he participated in are shown. In the present, Spike, currently a bounty hunter, and his partner Jet Black head to the Tijuana asteroid colony on their ship, the Bebop, to track down a bounty-head named Asimov Solensan. Asimov is wanted for killing members of his own crime syndicate and for stealing a cache of a dangerous combat drug known as Bloody-Eye. On the colony, Asimov and his girlfriend, Katerina, are ambushed at a bar by his former syndicate while attempting to sell a vial of Bloody-Eye, but Asimov manages to fight his way out by using the drug himself. Spike later encounters Katerina and reveals to her that he is a bounty hunter searching for Asimov; Spike is promptly assaulted by Asimov and is nearly killed before Katerina intervenes. In the confusion, Spike is able to steal Asimov's Bloody-Eye vial before the two leave. Spike later confronts Asimov at a staged drug deal with the stolen vial, but Asimov escapes with Katerina in a ship when the two are interrupted by an attack from Asimov's former syndicate. With Spike giving chase in his own ship, Asimov attempts to take another dose of Bloody-Eye, but a horrified Katerina shoots him before he can. As Spike approaches Asimov's ship, it is destroyed by attacking police cruisers, forcing Spike to pull away. The episode ends with Spike and Jet once again traveling through space on the Bebop. "

		 "Spike and Jet's next bounty takes them to Mars, where their target, Abdul Hakim, is wanted for stealing a valuable lab animal. To avoid capture, Hakim has had plastic surgery to change his appearance. At a bar, Hakim loses the briefcase containing the animal when it is stolen behind his back. Spike discovers the thief attempting to sell the animal at a pet store and, mistaking him for Hakim, holds him at gunpoint. Spike orders the store owner to open the case, revealing the animal to be a Welsh corgi. As Spike leaves the pet store, the real Hakim appears and attempts to take the dog back; the dog manages to escape, prompting Hakim, Spike, and the group of scientists who had illegally experimented on the dog to give chase. Spike ultimately loses Hakim but gains possession of the dog, whom he brings back to the Bebop. Jet suggests that Spike take the dog for a walk in order to lure Hakim into trying to take it back. However, the scientists activate a dog whistle to find their &quot;data dog&quot;, resulting in the corgi escaping from Spike. Hakim uses a stolen car and manages to grab the dog, while Spike and the scientists pursue him in their ship and truck, respectively. The dog manipulates the car's controls to open the doors and jumps out, causing Spike to reluctantly save it by having it land on top of his ship. Meanwhile, Hakim and the scientists crash their vehicles and are apprehended by the police. It is revealed that a &quot;data dog&quot; is a dog that has its intellect genetically enhanced. The dog, named Ein, is shown to now be living on the Bebop, much to Spike's chagrin."

Meanwhile, Spike and Jet pursue a bounty on the leader of the Space Warriors, a group of eco-terrorists armed with a terrifying biological weapon that can transform humans into apes. After once again running into Faye, Spike and Jet attempt to collect the bounty on the terrorists' leader, Twinkle Murdoch. However, faced with the threat by Murdoch's sons of releasing the virus on Ganymede if she isn't released, they cancel the bounty, forcing the Bebop crew to release her. When Murdoch and her sons renege on the deal and launch the virus anyway, Spike and Faye attempt to pursue her through the hyperspace gateway. They succeed in destroying two of the three missiles, but miss the third one, prompting the Ganymede government to shut down the spacegate, stopping the missiles by permanently trapping them in hyperspace. Spike and Faye manage to narrowly escape the gate before it closes, but Murdoch and sons become trapped, followed by a container of the virus that Faye recovered from the suitcase and was subsequently slipped into Murdoch's pocket by Spike to shatter, turning her and all her sons into monkeys. With the bounty lost, Faye decides to stay on the Bebop with Spike and Jet."

		 "A strange blob-like creature with a venomous bite infiltrates the Bebop and incapacitates Jet, Faye and Ein. With half the crew out of action, it's up to Spike and Ed to destroy the creature and find out where it came from.

		 This episode makes reference to the movie Alien, with Spike using a motion tracker and a flamethrower and by having the characters slowly attacked by an unknown alien one by one. The scene where Spike ejects the refrigerator into space was inspired by the scene in Aliens, where Ripley gets rid of the Alien queen. The episode's use of &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; from The Nutcracker is reminiscent of the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey's use of well-known classical music."
