		 "An Endless Wasteland",
		 "Soma Yukihira has been working at his father Joichiro's diner since a young age, establishing an interest in cooking and vowing to beat his father some day, for Joichiro has been beating him hollow everytime during their cooking battles. One day while his father is away, Yaeko Minegasaki, an urban life planner, arrives and threatens to demolish the restaurant to build a luxury hotel in its place, spoiling all the meat in the pantry to try and get the diner to close down. Remembering Soma's promise to always satisfy every customer that comes to dine, Yaeko orders him to make her a tasty meat dish to her satisfaction, and if he does she will never disturb him again. In response to the setback, Soma gathers his wits and uses potatoes and bacon bought while shopping to create an imitation roast pork dish, which Yaeko greatly enjoys and fulfills her portion of the deal. Despite the restaurant being saved, Joichiro decides to close it down for three years, opting to travel (and cook) abroad, sending Soma to the prestigious Totsuki Culinary Academy to take the entrance exam and study cooking there as part of the high school division."

		 "God Tongue",
		 "Upon arriving there, Soma is shocked by the grandness of the school building, the greatness of the school campus, and how famous Totsuki actually is, being one of the top culinary schools in the world. Soma also meets many other chefs, all of whom are descendants of gourmet chefs or heirs to high-class food businesses, who have likewise come to take the entrance exam and transfer in. Due to his background as a low-class diner chef, Soma is looked down on until most of the participants flee upon hearing that Erina Nakiri, a legendary food genius with the most selective palate known to mankind (nicknamed 'The God Tongue') will be their examiner. For fun, Erina changes the course of the exam and orders Soma to cook an egg dish to satisfy her instead. He conjures an ordinary-looking rice with seasoning, only to show it's true chicken flavour and egg saltiness enveloped inside. Despite being overwhelmingly impressed with his dish, Erina fails him, having taken an immediate dislike to his nonchalant and perceived cocky attitude, and feeling that her pride would be threatened if she allowed a person of his social standing to be admitted. Later in the day, her grandfather Senzaemon, the director of the school, tastes Soma's dish and is impressed, laughing and crumpling up his rejected application, implicitly overruling Erina's decision.

		 "That Chef Never Smiles",
		 "At the entrance ceremony, Soma is introduced as the only student who managed to transfer into Totsuki's high school division, and he declares that he will become the top student at Totsuki, instantly earning the ire of the entire student body with his nonchalant attitude towards the school and its reputation. He is then paired up with meek girl Megumi Tadokoro, who has the worst grades among the first-years and is one E grade away from expulsion. Soma's first class consists of making Beef Bourguignon to satisfy the French teacher Roland Chapelle, known as &quot;The Chef that Never Smiles&quot; due to his notoriously strict grading. Megumi is determined to follow the recipe to earn a passing grade, but encounters a setback when two other students sabotages their dish by throwing in lots of salt. Luckily, Soma comes through by using honey to quickly tenderize the meat. The class is astonished when Chapelle smiles for the first time upon trying Soma and Megumi's dish, and proclaims that his only regret is he cannot give them a grade higher than an A. The two saboteurs, having been distracted by Chapelle smiling, accidentally burn their own dish and receive a failing grade. Meanwhile, Erina is told about Soma's success in Chapelle's class and furiously vows to get him expelled. "

		 "Soma is sent to Polar Star Dormitory, a dormitory for students whose home is further away from the school. He is greeted by Fumio Daimidō, the caretaker, and is required to cook a dish that satisfies her in order to become a resident. Not knowing that he was supposed to provide his own ingredients, Soma nevertheless conjures a mackerel burger meal using leftover ingredients in the kitchen, which impresses Fumio greatly. Now a Polar Star Dormitory resident, Soma meets the other residents: first-year Yūki Yoshino who specialises in wild game, her best friend and fellow first-year Ryōko Sakaki who specializes in fermentation and alcoholic beverages, quiet first-year Shun Ibusaki who specialises in smoked food, first-year nerd Zenji Marui, bickering freshmans Daigo Aoki and Shōji Satō, enthusiastic second-year Satoshi Isshiki, as well as Megumi. During a welcoming party, Soma is further introduced to the academy's inner workings, such as the Elite Ten, the highest decision-making body in the school other than the school director himself, which consists of ten exceptionally talented students, the 10th seat being Erina while the 7th seat being Satoshi. Satoshi decides to challenge Soma to a cookoff. Satoshi presents his peppered mackerel dish and Soma is shocked by the elevated quality of Satoshi's cooking."

		 "Soma presents his dish, mackerel onigiri chazuke using seaweed tea. Everybody is impressed, and the cookoff is declared a draw. Having his sights set on becoming a member on the Elite Ten, he challenges Satoshi for his spot only to find out that it can only be obtained through a high-stakes cooking duel called a Shokugeki, and Soma has nothing of value to wager that is of equivalent value to his Elite Ten membership. Meanwhile, Erina challenges the Chanko Research Society president Kiyoshi Godabayashi to a Shokugeki for the rights to his clubroom, which she wins with ease. She then has his clubroom demolished in order to make room for a new wing for her personal cooking facilities."

		 "The Meat Invader",
		 "Megumi helps Soma to look for a club to join and stumble upon the Don Research Society, which is being targeted for disbandment by Erina for her expansion project. Ikumi Mito, one of Erina's enforcers known as &quot;The Meat Master&quot;, challenges the club president Kanichi Konishi, telling him that no matter what he cooks his dish will never beat her A5 grade meat. Seeing the events unfold, Soma volunteers to partake in the Shokugeki in Kanichi's place, with the challenge being to cook a donburi dish with meat as the main ingredient. The terms for the contest are that if Soma wins, the club stays with increased funding and Ikumi must join, but if Ikumi wins, the club disbands and Soma will be expelled. In preparing for the Shokugeki, Soma makes numerous donburi dishes through research and modifies them with the realization that the club's budget is limited. Soma settles on the Chaliapin steak, while Ikumi, heir to a massive meat packaging business, contacts her family to deliver the best cut of A5 grade beef available."

		 "At the Shokugeki, Ikumi wows the audience with her A5 grade beef, while Soma is mocked for using discount supermarket beef. Ikumi completes her A5 Japanese Beef Roti Don first, with the judges being extremely impressed with the taste and quality of her beef. Soon after, Soma presents his Chaliapin Steak Don to the judges, who, after initially refusing to taste it, try his dish and are unable to stop eating, resulting in a unanimous win for Soma. Soma addresses Ikumi's dish, pointing out that she misunderstood the concept of donburi by placing too much emphasis on the beef and not the donburi as a whole, as the judges were too full from eating the beef to finish the rice. With Soma's victory, Ikumi has her personal kitchen taken away from her by Erina but develops a crush on Soma after he calls her by her nickname &quotNikumi&quot;. Ikumi joins Don RS and is immediately outraged and embarrassed to learn Soma did not join the club with her, as he had only visited Don RS in the first place to research donburi recipes to add to his restaurants menu."

		 "The Concerto of Inspiration and Imagination",
		 "The first year students at Totsuki Academy go to a training camp as their first major challenge during which about half of the first year students usually receive a failing grade and are expelled. The students are given various challenges with alumni from the school brought in to be judges. The first challenge for Soma's group, that includes Megumi and the Aldini twins Takumi and Isami, is to make a dish that can be served at a Japanese restaurant using ingredients gathered from nature in the area surrounding the kitchen with former Second Seat Hinako Inui judging their dishes. Takumi, heir to his family restaurant in Tuscany, &quot;Tratoria Aldini&quot;, challenges Soma to a duel to see who can cook the better dish as they both specialize in diner-style dishes. Most of the students gather fish while the Aldini twins find a duck for their dish. They are the first to complete their dish and Inui passes them."

Soma takes Inui's kaki peanuts on the understanding that any ingredient found in the area can be used. Soma and Megumi gather ingredients and arrive with 15 minutes left and they make the Char Okakiage using the peanuts as a crust for the fish. Inui expresses her satisfaction and passes Soma and Megumi, but she does not declare a winner between Takumi and Soma as she is ordered to depart immediately. Takumi leaves vowing to challenge Soma to a Shokugeki should they meet again. The students return to the hotel where they are ordered to each cook 50 servings of a steak dinner to serve to the Bodybuilding, Football and Wrestling Clubs with no chance to rest after having spent all day cooking, and with the risk of immediate expulsion unless all 50 servings are cooked within 1 hour. Soma finishes quickly and heads to the public bath where he runs into Erina, having just finished her own bath."

		 "Soma apologizes for knocking Erina over, but Erina refuses his help thinking that she is letting her guard down. Soma meets alumnus and Totsuki Resort head chef Gin Dojima in the bath, who is surprised to see that Soma finished so quickly. Dojima wishes Soma good luck as Takumi Aldini enters the bath, with Aldini shocked to see Soma having casual conversation with a legend like Dojima. The next day, Soma and Megumi are assigned the task of making the Nine Vegetable Terrine, but this time individually instead of as partners. Alumnus Kojiro Shinomiya, who will be judging the dishes, tells the students to think of each other as enemies. In the mad rush to claim the best ingredients, the unassertive Megumi is pushed aside and finds only bad heads of cauliflower remaining by the time she reaches the table. Thinking about what Soma would do in such a situation, Megumi uses wine vinegar to preserve the color and enhance the seasoning of the cauliflower. Shinomiya passes Soma, but fails Megumi for making unauthorized changes to the recipe. Soma defends Megumi fearlessly in the face of the intimidating Shinomiya, angering the latter, who reveals that he intentionally provided a limited number of good cauliflower heads to limit the number of students who could pass. A furious Soma challenges Shinomiya to a Shokugeki to get Megumi's expulsion rescinded."

		 "Shinomiya initially refuses Soma's challenge, however Dojima and Inui were passing by and pressured him into accepting the challenge. Thus, Soma and Megumi battle Shinomiya in an unofficial Shokugeki under the condition that Megumi is the lead chef as this Shokugeki is designed to prove Megumi's worthiness as a chef. While Shinomiya makes his dish, Megumi becomes tense at the sight of his dish. Soma tells her to relax and to focus on making something that's representative of herself and not what Shinomiya is doing. Shinomiya presents his dish first, the Chou farci, and the judges give overwhelming praise to the dish. However Dojima is not satisfied by the dish as it was not from one of his specialties. Megumi then presents her dish, the Rainbow Terrine. "

		 "Megumi manages to impress the judges with her Rainbow Terrine, which emphasises the maturity of vegetables. However, when it comes down to voting, all three judges vote for Shinomiya's dish based on the difference between their skill. Just then, Dojima gives his own vote towards Megumi's dish, stating that Shinomiya has allowed his cooking to become stale, his status as a world famous chef having prevented him from developing his skills any further. This is revealed in flashbacks to be related to how his climb to fame involved making sure his dishes were totally by the book with no tolerance for any kind of changes to an established recipe. When Shinomiya tries Megumi's dish for himself, he comes to understand how her dish was geared towards the needs of those eating it and puts in his own vote for Megumi. With Inui also casting her vote for Megumi, the Shokugeki ends in a tie, with Shinomiya revoking Megumi's expulsion. As Megumi returns back to her concerned friends, Soma laments what is technically his very first defeat."

With everyone spending the night trying to come up with a recipe, Soma decides on a soufflé omelette, which is met with silent criticism from some of the other students. As breakfast comes the next day, it is revealed the judges will consist of the hotel's guests and staff, with students needing to hand out 200 servings of their dish in order to pass. While many of the students including Erina, Megumi, and Takumi all manage to impress with their dishes, Soma struggles to serve his dish to anyone."

With half an hour left in the challenge, Soma calmly analyzes the situtation and changes his approach, cooking in front of his customers in order to attract a crowd while also delivering the dish in its peak condition. Optimizing his preparation time to cook his omelettes as quickly as possible, Soma manages to complete his 200 servings goal with merely seconds to spare. Afterwards, Soma is introduced to Erina's cousin, Alice Nakiri, who considers both Soma and Erina her rivals. Following another task a few hours later, Dojima treats all the surviving students with a banquet to celebrate the end of the training camp, while withholding information about the next event: the Autumn Selection."

Going back for his headband, Soma ends up missing his bus and has to hitch a ride back to school with Erina, who explains about the Autumn Festival while hiding the fact that she, along with Dojima, are shown to have fond memories of Joichiro. Returning to the Polar Star Dormitory, Soma is surprised to see Joichiro, who is revealed to be an alumnus and former member of the Elite Ten who went by the name Jouchirou Saiba. As Joichiro treats the returning residents to a meal, Fumio explains that Joichiro and Dojima were once fellow Polar Star residents who were responsible for many of the luxuries the dorm has. Later that night, Joichiro tells Soma about his campus memories, filling him with more determination. The next morning, Joichiro decides to have a cooking contest against Soma."

Soma presents an apple risotto, which provides a crisp taste which changes with the addition of black pepper. Joichiro, on the other hand, presents the unusual choice of ramen which, despite its heavy appearance, turns out to be a mellow and warming vegetarian dish, providing powerful flavor without meat or fish. The judges unanimously vote Joichiro's dish the winner, though Soma's dish also receives some praise.

He learns that the Sumire Shopping District has been doing poor business lately due to the arrival of a popular karaage chain shop, Mozuya. Wanting to help revive the shopping district, Soma decides to come up with a competing karaage recipe, calling in Ikumi as his meat expert while Mayu winds up as his taste tester (due to the efforts of mutual friend Aki Koganei to set Mayu up with Soma). The three do some recon at Mozuya, where they find its CEO Kinu Nakamozu to be a spiteful woman, before beginning work on a karaage recipe of their own. As Soma takes up Mayu's suggestion to use their shopping district location to their advantage, it is revealed that the figure behind Mozuya's success is one of the Elite Ten."

		 "Noting that the shopping district focuses more on walk-and-eat food, as opposed to Mozuya's packaged approach, Soma shifts his focus towards creating a karaage that can be enjoyed straight out of the fryer. Opting to go with chicken thigh meat with a chilli-based marinade, Soma gets inspiration from a bento shop owner and decides to serve his karaage in rice flour wraps with salad, providing enhanced flavor, portability, and appeal all at once. This brings a large amount of business, which in turns helps the rest of the shopping district come back to life, with Nakamozu having no choice but to admit defeat. Afterwards, Soma puts Mayu in charge of helping with the karaage's sales, having noted her good qualities. Returning to the academy, Soma is brought before Mozuya's puppetmaster, Etsuya Eizan, the ninth seat of the Elite Ten, who informs him that he has been chosen for the Autumn Elections."

Meanwhile, Megumi is approached by a girl named Miyoko Hojo, who was interested in her shokugeki with Shinomiya but becomes disappointed when she hears she was helped by Soma. After learning the first dish of the elections is a curry dish, Soma and Megumi pay a visit to Jun Shiomi, an instructor and former Polar Star alumna who specializes in curry and spices, along with her assistant Akira Hayama, who is also in the elections. Using Jun's theories on spices, Akira demonstrates how preparing the same ingredients of a curry dish in different ways can yield drastically different results. Becoming wowed by the powerful flavors of Akira's curry, Soma becomes determined to beat him with an even better curry dish at the preliminaries. "

With the cooking period over, the judging soon begins with a harsh panel of judges hitting most of the students with low scores. In Group B, Nao Sadatsuka, a somewhat creepy girl with an obsession with Erina, presents an extremely pungent laksa dish made using kusaya that secretly carries a delicious flavor under its strong odor, scoring 84 points as a result. Meanwhile, Erina's secretary and childhood friend Hisako Arato, who Nao has a rivalry with, presents a mutton curry made using medicinal cuisine which undoes the cursive effects of Nao's curry, scoring 92 points.

Finally, Soma presents his own fragrance bomb, combining his past two failures into a curry risotto omurice containing a mango chutney that deepens the flavor. The dish earns Soma 93 points, landing him second place behind Akira, though it is noted by the crowd that despite Akira receiving a higher score overall three of the five judges ranked Soma's dish higher than Akira's, with the implication being that in a Shokugeki, this would have given Soma the victory. As the contestants hold an afterparty celebrating and lamenting their victories and losses in the preliminaries, Soma becomes determined to improve his cooking finesse."
