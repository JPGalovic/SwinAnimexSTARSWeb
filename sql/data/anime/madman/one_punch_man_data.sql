		 "Vaccine Man wreaks havoc in a city. But as he is about to kill a young girl, Saitama arrives and saves her. Saitama has been living a boring life, as he has extraordinary strength in which he can defeat enemies in one punch. He recalls three years ago, when he was leaving a job interview, he had saved a boy with a cleft-chin from Crablante. Back at the present time, he faces The Brain and Brawn Brothers, one of whom is a huge giant, and defeats them easily. One night, he has a dream about a subterranean race who invade and pose a challenge, but when he wakes, he finds that the subterraneans are extremely weak."

Dr. Genus eventually discovers the secret to immortality and makes himself young again, clones himself multiple times, and then works on animals and humanoids to create the monsters that make up the House of Evolution. Saitama cuts off the narration for being too long, at which Armored Gorilla summarizes that Genus just wants to capture Saitama for his experiments. Genos destroys Dr. Genus's eight-floor tower, prompting Dr. Genus to unleash his ultimate creation, Carnage Kabuto, who at first is afraid of Saitama's aura of overwhelming power. Kabuto asks Saitama his secret to his strength, at which Saitama happily tells him, Genos, and Dr. Genus that it is a daily regimen of physical exercise and eating right, much to their disbelief. Kabuto attacks Saitama, but when Saitama realizes that today was supposed to be the big supermarket sale, he quickly punches Kabuto into pieces, and leaves with Genos to rush to the sale. Afterwards, Dr. Genus abandons his research. "

They then attend an orientation seminar from Snakebite Snek, who is annoyed that Saitama does not pay attention to him. Snek tries to teach him a lesson, only to embarrass himself when he is defeated by Saitama who was not even trying. Having received new upgrades, Genos asks Saitama to spar with him and do it seriously.

		 "The Terrifying City",
		 "Saitama tries to come up with ideas for mentoring Genos, but when Genos mentions that C-class heroes who are inactive for more than a week are dropped from their registry, he rushes around to look for petty villains around town without much success. Sonic appears to try to settle their alleged rivalry, but Saitama finds him annoying. Tank-Top Tiger reproaches Saitama for his antics and tries to absorb the credit of being a hero when Sonic attacks them and the populace. Saitama realizes Sonic is doing villanous things and swiftly taps him on the back, knocking him out cold, saving the day. Later that day around Saitama's old neighborhood, a mysterious being was seen skulking around frightening the few masses who lived in the desolate Z-City; perturbed at not being sent out to deal with it, Tatsumaki berates the assignment staff. They have already sent out A-Class' Golden Ball and Spring Mustachio out to the scene. In Z-City the two aforementioned heroes are busy patrolling the streets, wondering about a rumor of a pretty dangerous monster who lives in said area. After finding next to nothing on the job, they eventually find signs of said Mysterious Being and chase after it. Running into Kombu Infinity, who also heard rumors of a powerful group of monsters in the city, engaged the duo and easily swats the best efforts of both aside. Realizing they are outmatched, Mustachio dials for reinforcements just before he is swiftly defeated. Upset that his opponents were so weak, Kombu sets out to create the rumor he and his fellow monsters initially heard about; soon after Saitama returns from a market sale, when Kombu notices him as the former relents on not having been able to secure some kombu soup stalk just before the monster attacks him. When next seen, Saitama is just cooking some kombu soup when Genos comes in. Later Tatsumaki is seen berating the assignment staff for not sending her in to fight. In the post-credits, Genos tells Saitama that, while he's in 17th place within the S-class, he's ranked 6th in popularity, much to Saitama's dismay. Genos then starts reading some online comments about him, but a jealous Saitama tells him to stop. "

		 "The Ultimate Disciple",
		 "Just before an incident, scientists and astronomers are busy studying the flight pattern of a meteorite just as it passes over the earth. When its course suddenly changes trajectory a mass warning system breaks out that a huge meteor is about to strike City Z. A notice is sent out to all S-Class heroes to intercept the meteor. Genos receives the notice while at home, conversing with Saitama about hero rankings. However, only Genos arrives on the scene, followed by an aged S-Class hero Bang. He tells Genos the meteor evacuation protocols have already begun and that he should clear out before it is too late, Bang himself cannot leave the city due to family honor and personal reasons, and before he could formally introduce himself, Genos has already left. Genos theorizes that it is too late to evacuate, seeing the meteor approaching too fast. His resolutions affirmed when he realized that his master also lives in this city. Another S-Class hero named Metal Knight shows up to test out a new weapon against the meteor but is uninterested in teaming up with another hero to avert the crisis. When his new weapon fails, Genos used his own prototype weapon on the meteor. Despite the overwhelming power displayed, he fails to stop the meteor. Saitama shows up and destroys the meteor with a single punch, impressing Bang and boosting Genos' admiration toward Saitama. However, the meteor shatters into several meteorites and still manages to destroy the city. The next day, Saitama learns that his rank has jumped from 300th to 5th, although he still remains a C-Class hero. Genos theorizes that, despite Saitama's S-Class achievement, people must have believed it was Genos and Metal Knight who had destroyed the meteor. After a quick discussion about threat levels and words of being a hero that inspires Genos, Saitama goes out to look for more crisis to boost his own rank. Much of the city is destroyed but despite that, there are zero casualties reported. Tanktop Tiger appears and believes Saitama has stolen credit for the meteor destruction. Tanktop Tiger calls his brother Tanktop Black Hole, who begins to rally up a mob against Saitama, putting all the blame on him for the city's destruction. Tanktop Tiger attacks Saitama, who was later punched into the sky. Tanktop Blackhole attacks next, and Saitama catches his fist, crushing it. Saitama then moves on to the crowd, who were chanting for his resignation, and he shouts for everyone to shut up. Saitama clarifies that he is being a hero because he wants to and does not need to be appreciated for it. Genos appears and tells Saitama that it is time for them to go home, and speaking internally, despite what the world thinks of Saitama, he knows that his master is the greatest hero of all. In the post-credits, a myriad of creatures located under the sea discuss Saitama's victory over the meteor. "

		 "The Deep Sea King",
		 "The episode opens with an octopus-like monster announcing that the Seafolk are coming to the surface to kill all the humans. Saitama is on his way home from shopping and stops by to punch the messenger. Mumen Rider is late to the scene and sees only the destroyed body of the creature, and hears the crowd talking about Saitama. Mumen looks Saitama up on the internet and sees that he is powerful, but opinions are divided on him. At the coast, several large Sea-Folk monsters emerge from the sea, threatening City J. The Class A hero Stinger (rank 11) challenges them with his powerful Bamboo Shoot weapon. Meanwhile, Genos is drying dishes with his rocket hands as Saitama watches a news report about Stinger's battle against the Sea-Folk. They decide to head out to confront the threat. Back at the fight, Stinger takes out the last four Seafolk with a Gigantic Drill Stinger Quadruple Thrust attack, but is then bested by a new monster: Deep Sea King. Saitama, Genos, and Mumen Rider all set off to confront the threat. Genos splits off from Saitama to scout ahead. Various other heroes confront Deep Sea King to no avail, including Lightning Max (class A), Puri-Puri Prisoner (class S), and Sonic (not technically a hero). Sonic fights Sea King to a standstill, but when it starts raining, Sea King unleashes his true form and Sonic is forced to retreat. Meanwhile, Saitama and Mumen Rider meet each other on the way to the fight. Saitama goes off to find Sonic who he sees running naked through the rain. Mumen gets a phone call from Hero Association headquarters and goes to confront Sea King, who has broken into an emergency shelter and is dispatching the heroes there ranging from All Back-Man, Bunbunman, Jet Nice Guy, and Sneck. Saitama returns to where he met Mumen Rider to find a discarded cell phone. The episode ends with Saitama telling the Hero Association he is on his way. "

		 "Unyielding Justice",
		 "As Saitama is waiting for the Hero Association to decide whether they want him to help fight the Deep Sea King or not, Genos initiates battle, and seemingly defeats the monster with a massive attack. However, he lets his guard down and gets one of his arms ripped off. He tells the townspeople to run while he distracts the monster, since victory is no longer assured. He seems to be doing a good job, until the Deep Sea King launches a glob of acid at a child, which Genos intercepts, and it melts his bionic body, nearly killing him. In that moment, right before the Sea King would have finished Genos off, Mumen Rider appears and engages the Deep Sea King. He is defeated easily, but refuses to give up. Upon seeing this, the townspeople decide to encourage him, but to no avail. When Mumen Rider is knocked out, he is caught by Saitama, who had been instructed by the Association to provide backup and arrives in that exact moment. After exchanging a few words with the Deep Sea King, he defeats him with a single punch which also stops the rain and is praised by the townspeople. Sonic also reappears with his weapons in a different part of town, but assumes the Sea King must have fled. Back at their apartment, Genos and Saitama get a delivery of fan mail from the Hero Association. Genos is praised, while Saitama gets a hateful letter, calling him a cheat. The episode reverts to a flashback from right after Saitama's victory. The townspeople are ecstatic to have been saved and are impressed by Saitama's swift victory. However, one of them starts badmouthing the other heroes, saying how they must have been frauds, no matter their rank, since they got beaten. His reasoning is that the Deep Sea King could not have been that tough if a Class C hero defeated it in one punch. Upon hearing this, Saitama laughs, and downplays his victory to save the reputations of the other heroes by saying that he got lucky and the job was easy for him, since he came late and the monster had been weakened. He also tells the townspeople to care for the fallen heroes, so he can continue to cash in on their work. The townspeople accept him as nothing but a fraud and thank the defeated heroes for their work. Genos decides not to interfere with Saitama's decision, but promises to intervene if this choice were ever to push Saitama into a corner in the future. The episode jumps back to present time, and Saitama realizes he has another letter - this one only saying &quot;Thank You!&quot;. He then finds a third letter from the Hero Association, telling him he is now 1st Rank C-class, and calling him in to discuss a promotion to B class. Saitama accepts, making him 101st Rank, B-class. The episode jumps to Amai Mask during what seems to be a photo shoot. One of his subordinates tells him that Saitama moved up a rank. Amai Mask seems to not care, as he is disappointed by the work of the A- and S-Rank heroes in the Sea King case. However, he changes his mind when he is told that Saitama was the one to actually defeat the monster. Meanwhile in the hospital, Lightning Mask and Stinger are recuperating when Puri-Puri Prisoner enters wanting to administer "Angel Shots" to the two. They escape, dropping the newspapers they had been reading, and Puri-Puri Prisoner is upset when he sees that he is called an &quot;S-Rank Failure&quot; in the news. The episode ends with Saitama walking home at night with his promotion. He encounters Mumen Rider in a roadside oden shop. Mumen Rider reveals he sent the thank-you letter and pays for Saitama's dinner. In the post-credits, a fortune teller named Madame Shibabawa warns an official from the Hero Association that &quot;the Earth is doomed&quot;. "

At Bang's dojo, Bang tells Saitama and Genos, who were called there by Bang to learn some moves, about how his former best student, Garo, went wild and defeated all of his other top students. Suddenly, a Hero Association member comes and informs the heroes that an emergency has been declared and all S Class heroes have been called to a meeting.

Sitch, a member of the associations, starts the meeting by telling the heroes that the emergency would be perilous and even with their skills, there is no guarantee of survival. Also, the great seer, Madame Shibabawa, had died while becoming agitated and choking on a cough pill because of a coughing fit while predicting the future. Sitch mentions that Shibabawa's predictions have always been 100% accurate, be it monster attacks or natural disasters. Before she died, she left a note, thought to be her greatest prophecy. The note read &quot;The Earth is in trouble&quot;, alarming the heroes. He warns the heroes to prepare for a fight in the next 6 months. Just after he says this, the HQ is attacked by the Skyfolk led by Sky King, who are quickly slain by Melzalgald, a member of an alien race called the Dark Matter Thieves. An alien spacecraft then proceeds to destroy City A, causing a large number of casualties as their alien invasion begins. Just as Melzalgald is about to kill some City A civilians, Iairon, a student of Atomic Samurai, arrives and engages him in battle. Saitama encounters the alien ship and advances towards it, avoiding some projectiles thrown at him and damaging the ship. Meanwhile, Melzalgald proves to be a challenge for Iaian and causes him to lose his left arm before Atomic Samurai intervenes, saving his student from death. Melzalgald, however, regenerates and the heroes' attacks seem to cause no damage to him. Then, Metal Bat, Bang and Puri Puri Prisoner arrives. Puri Puri Prisoner enters Angel style and attacks Melzalgald. Elsewhere, the other S Class heroes discuss how to bring down the ship. As they offer differing views, Genos notes that Saitama has already entered the ship and slain a large number of the aliens. He comments that there is no evil that Saitama is unable to defeat. Saitama encounters Goribas, an alien, bragging how to defeat him. But is slain, as Saitama punches at everything and continues to destroy the ship, wondering where the boss might be. At the end, Boros is seen on his throne. "

Boros walks in and Geryuganshoop informs Lord Boros that the ship is badly damaged by the human intruder but Lord Boros tells him not to fear as the sphere keeping them safe won't allow that to happen. Meanwhile, below the ship, Puri Puri Prisoner's efforts were futile as Melzargard simply regenerates back into his form. Iaian tells the other heroes that it is pointless to keep trying. Melzargard tells his other head to go and contact the ship for a bombardment. As the head flies away, Metal Bat smacks him down. Melzargard and Geryuganshoop telepathically tell each other that both sides are dealing with big trouble as Saitama reaches another door. Atomic Samurai, Puri Puri Prisoner and Bang join forces and attack Melzargard together as Iaian tells them once more that direct hits have no effect on it. He tells them to retreat and think of a better way to handle the situation. Atomic Samurai, Puri Puri Prisoner, Bang and Metal Bat keeps attacking Melzargard telling Iai it is the only thing they know. Melzargard and Genryuganshoop again speak telepathically saying the life forms below are persistently attacking him and requested for a cleansing bombardment. Genryuganshoop is too busy but notifies the artillery crew. Genryuganshoop leaves the conversation and while Melzargard was distracted, Metal Bat finds a marble within Melzargard before he could regenerate thus destroying the marble and part of Melzargard for good. Genryuganshoop tries to lead Saitama out of the ship and Saitama went the opposite direction to find the controls room. He finally finds Genryuganshoop who has incredible telepathic powers that can manipulate everything and anything but in the end Saitama throws a pebble at him that destroys Genryuganshoop. After busting the other heads, the four heroes look up with shell bombardment ready to attack. After it shoots, Tatsumaki appears and stops the bullets in mid air, cursing the other four heroes fighting Melzargard. She then turns the bullets and forces them back onto the ship full force. Mumen Rider helps evacuate a victim to safety, when Stinger and Lightning Max appear wanting to help too. Bang on the other hand finds another marble and crushes it. Angry, Melzargard slaps the concrete along with Bang, who takes a direct hit. He sticks on a building, unconscious. With one more head left, Melzargard threatens to crush Atomic Samurai's head and he retaliates after seeing his comrade in that condition. Saitama finds Boros who scans him for power, saying Saitama is Earth's strongest warrior with limitless energy. Boros treats Saitama with respect and tells him his name and the prophecy that brought the Dominator of the Universe to Earth. Saitama punches Boros after being annoyed with what he heard, telling him he can't attack other planets just to liven up his boring life. Boros' armor used to seal in his immense power breaks apart and his true form emerges. "
