		 "Outbreak:Genesis",
		 "In 2039, Shu Ouma is a socially awkward student living in Japan, where it is under the strict rule of the government organization named GHQ following the outbreak of the Apocalypse Virus ten years earlier. While going to his warehouse studio, he encounters Inori Yuzuriha, an internet singer of the band Egoist, who is recovering from her wounds after stealing the Void Genome, a genetic weapon stored in a vial, from GHQ, keeping it safe inside her pet robot Funell. Inori is then captured by the GHQ Anti-Bodies division led by Major Guin. To make amends upon her request, Shu brings the Void Genome to Inori's boss, Gai Tsutsugami, leader of the resistance group called Funeral Parlor (Undertakers). However, Guin orders the Anti-Bodies to exterminate the residents of Roppongi in order to find the Void Genome. As Funeral Parlor and GHQ battle, Shu goes to rescue Inori, protecting her when a GHQ humanoid war machine known as an Endlave tries to attack them. The attack shatters the vial holding the Void Genome, giving Shu the &quot;Power of the King&quot;, which he uses to extract Inori's Void, in the form of a sword, in order to destroy the Endlave. "

After commending hacker Tsugumi and paraplegic Endlave pilot Ayase Shinomiya for their hard work, Gai not only lectures Inori for allowing Shu to absorb the Void Genome since the former had intended to use it, but he also states that Shu can no longer stand idly by with the power the latter now possesses. Later, Funeral Parlor proceeds to stop Guin, who took a group of innocent civilians hostage to have Daryl and the Anti-Bodies execute them. Funeral Parlor launches an attack and tricks Daryl to drive his Endlave Steiner away from Guin's command center to hijack it. Gai then reveals himself and has a standoff with Guin, in which Shu heads toward Daryl, cutting through his cockpit and extracts his Void, a weapon that produces myriad of barriers. As the standoff reaches its climax, Guin orders his men to fire at Gai, however Shu uses Daryl's Void to shield Gai and deflect the lasers fired, annihilating Guin and the Anti-Bodies. In the aftermath, despite witnessing the atrocities GHQ are responsible for and what Funeral Parlor stands for, Shu declines Gai's offer to join them.

Shu reveals his own Void, a crystallized arm that replaces his lost one and has the power to gather the strengths and weaknesses of other people's Voids. By using the power of his friends' Voids, Shu defeats Segai's Endlaves and kills Segai himself. However, everyone finds out that Shu not only absorbed Souta's Void, but also his viral infection as well. "

		 "At GHQ Headquarters, Gai makes a worldwide announcement that the Leukocyte will destroy the world on December 25th. The remnants of Funeral Parlor, the Kuhouin Group and Tennouzu High School students escape Japan on a ship, where Shibungi, released by Gai, gives Shu a journal written by Kurosu detailing the history the Apocalypse Virus. In 2013, Keido, a college professor researching on Genomic Resonance, befriended his student Kurosu, who was interested in his research. In 2017, Kurosu married his colleague named Saeko Shijou, moving in with her after she became pregnant with Mana. In 2022, a meteorite crashed on Earth, first discovered by Mana and Saeko. In 2023, Keido and Kurosu discovered a virus inside the meteorite, which reacted when the Genomic Resonance was used, meaning Mana and Saeko were infected. Yu, the representative of Da'ath, offered to help them with their research, believing that the virus will start the Apocalypse. Yu ordered Kurosu to disallow Saeko to have an abortion during her pregnancy with Shu, since Mana chose Shu as her mate to start a new race after the Apocalypse, but after Saeko died by the virus after childbirth, a grieving Kurosu refused to work with Da'ath anymore. Keido later joined Da'ath by helping them find a more suitable mate for Mana by experimenting on children with the Apocalypse Virus. In 2028, Kurosu, who have since kept busy on finding a cure for the virus, fell in love with his new assistant Haruka, who also took care of Kurosu and his children, eventually marrying him. At the same time, Keido adopted Gai, who was a victim of child trafficking, but subjected him in the experiments, eventually leading Gai to run away and encounter Shu and Mana on the beach. In 2029, on the day of the Lost Christmas incident, Keido became bitter and jealous after learning that Kurosu managed to find a cure for the virus by creating the Void Genome, but wanted to keep the burden creating it on himself. When Kurosu caught Keido in his office, Keido killed Kurosu and stole his research before Haruka found her husband's body. In the present, Haruka reveals that Mana was able to enter Inori's body during the second outbreak and slowly taking control of her because the Voids that Shu have been extracting are pieces of Mana herself. When Shu tries to return the Voids back to his friends, they all refuse already knowing that he is risking their lives, and Shu forgives Souta for betraying him. Shu, Tsugumi, Ayase, Argo, Shibungi, Haruka and Kurachi set off with allies from the United Nations to attack GHQ Headquarters. "

		 "As it is realized the 256 Leukocyte satellites was a bluff, Shu promises his friends and allies that they will stop Gai and rescue Inori. Ayase allows Shu to help her into her new Endlave Steiner. Gai uses the Voids of Arisa, Kenji and Yu to decimate some of the United Nations fleet. Thanks to Tsugumi's void, Shu and Funeral Parlor manage to sneak inside and hack into the base system, allowing the United Nation fleet the chance to counterattack. As Tsugumi part ways with Shu and the others, Gai prepares to get rid of Inori's memories before Mana can take over her body. Gai questions Inori why she loves Shu, to which she responds that Shu showed her the value of life, both its pain and beauty. As crystals take over her body, Inori sings a song only audible to Shu, who leads Funeral Parlor to the center of GHQ Headquarters. Shu is separated from his allies and is confronted by Yu, while Funeral Parlor faces against Endlave led by Daryl, who now operates the new model Endlave Gespenst. Yu, revealing that he is actually an embodiment of the will of Da'ath, is impressed on how far Shu has done and offers him to become Mana's mate, but Shu refuses. Yuu uses the Voids of his followers to attack Shu, lamenting on how Shu squandered his chance to restart the human race all because of Inori, described as a &quot;doll&quot. However, Shu tells Yu that Inori is a human being, who was always there when he was down, vowing to rescue her. Defeated, Yuu allows Shu to meet Inori before disappearing. Shu confronts Gai, who reveals Inori has finally transformed into Mana. "

		 "Mana, now completely resurrected, greets Shu, but he shuns her after she speaks ill of Inori, much to her anger. Gai draws out Mana's Void to fight Shu while she triggers the Fourth Apocalypse, spreading the Apocalypse Virus throughout the entire world. Haruka confronts Keido, who commits suicide by injecting the virus into himself while admitting defeat. Meanwhile, Funeral Parlor continue their fight with the group of Endlaves led by Daryl, who believes he changed because of them and wants to go back to his old self. Tsugumi finds that her attempts to hack the based system are being repelled by another hacker as skilled as her, in which Shibungi figures out that Kenji is responsible for this. Shibungi tracks down where Kenji is located and kills him, allowing Tsugumi to operate freely and help Ayase defeat Daryl. Just when Shu is about to be killed by Gai, Shu sees a flower within the crystallization while hearing Inori's voice. He pulls out Inori's Void within the flower with his last strength, using it to defeat Gai with a finishing blow. Before dying, Gai reveals that his actions were needed, so that Mana can start the Fourth Apocalypse so she would finally be able to rest, otherwise she would always be resurrected by Da'ath. Shu recovers the Void Genome that Gai stole from him, using its power to stop the Fourth Apocalypse from happening. Shu uses his Void to draw in all of his friends' Voids to cure them of the virus, slowly being consumed by the virus, but Inori sacrifices herself to save Shu's life. Ayase, Tsugumi, Argo, Shibungi, Arisa, Daryl, Haruka and Kurachi manage to escape GHQ Headquarters before it collapses. Some years later, Tokyo is finally rebuilt and Shu, now visually impaired with a mechanical prosthetic right arm, celebrates Hare's birthday with Ayase, Tsugumi, Yahiro, Souta and Kanon. Shu later sits on a bench beside a lake to hear one of Inori's songs while reminiscing about his days with her."
