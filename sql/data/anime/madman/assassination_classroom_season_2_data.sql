Koro-sensei and the students decide to set up a romantic dinner for the two teachers to get them together. Irina kisses her napkin and places it on Karasuma's lips as a subtle confession before leaving, but Karasuma seems to be more focused on his duty rather getting her message. On the final day of summer vacation, Koro-sensei invites his students to the local summer festival. Meanwhile, Lovro Brovski is attacked by a mysterious assassin."
