		 "In a world where dirty jokes don't exist, where the mere utterance of a ***** word will thrust you into jail, a hero must rise up as a symbol for all things lewd and rude. The mysterious Blue Snow, proudly wearing panties on her face and armed with naughty images and a foul mouth, will bring the art of dirty jokes back! With her erotic terrorist group, SOX, she will press against the stiff authority of the oppressive Decency Squad and step on their hard and overbearing rules. 

		 Tanukichi Okuma is the son of an imprisoned ero-terrorist. Rather than following in his father's footsteps, he plans to stay on the track of morality and wholesomeness. Just like his dream girl, Anna Nishikinomiya, he attends Japan's most moral school. But after an encounter with Blue Snow, his virtuous plans are ****** and he finds himself entangled with SOX. Will the pursuit of smut tarnish what hope he has with the pure Anna, or will he *** around, stimulated by the panty wearing deviant and her filthy mouth?",

		 "Tanukichi Okuma heads to school by monorail where he looks forward to reuniting with his crush, Anna. After trying to defuse a tense situation, he finds himself about to be arrested by the moral police when the infamous perverted terrorist Blue Snow appears, spreading lewd leaflets around the train station and threatening to strip naked while Tanukichi escapes in the confusion. Later at school, Tanukichi's troubles continue as a classmate demands he answer how babies are made, and then the Student Council brings him in to ask that he hunt down Blue Snow before her influence spreads to the school. Later that day, he heads to a quiet cafe with Ayame who then ties him to a chair and reveals that she is actually Blue Snow. After being threatened into joining her crusade, Tanukichi helps her execute a plan at school during a student assembly, first spreading more perverted leaflets around the packed gym and then tricking the teachers into running outside while Ayame plays a video of two flies mating while she adds her own sound effects. Meanwhile, Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and starts drawing a giant asterisk sign on the track with a line painting machine. The entire school, including Tanukichi, finds themselves having trouble dealing with the weird new feelings brought on by this act."

		 "The Mysteries of Pregnancy",
		 "While the school is recovering from Blue Snow's latest activity, Tanukichi recalls his own past and his connection to Anna, gaining the trust of the Student Council. Ayame then tasks him with copying and spreading increasingly-rare paper inserts with suggestive pornographic material across the school. Anna even hangs one such picture in the Student Council room, unaware of the double-meaning behind it until Tanukichi points it out. Tanukichi crushes on Anna again, but Ayame quietly warns him not to pursue her, as she can be frightening when angry, and that Anna's parents were responsible for the current and potential-future morals laws that have a stranglehold on Japan. Later, Ayame decides to hatch another plot at school during physical exams for the freshmen students. Ayame distracts Anna and Goriki while Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and attempts to teach some students dirty words by sight. However, Anna catches the disguised Tanukichi before he can finish and chases him around the school, cornering him until Ayame appears as the real Blue Snow with the captured urine samples of the freshmen boys. As Anna and Goriki race after her, Tanukichi takes off his Blue Snow disguise, unaware that an artistic student spotted him from a nearby roof."

		 "How to Love Someone",
		 "During an award ceremony for Otome Saotome's work, Otome dramatically rips up her certificate on stage and claims she is in a slump. Later, Otome drags Tanukichi out of class and threatens to reveal his connection to Blue Snow unless he helps her resolve a romantic issue. Meanwhile, Anna finds herself dealing with a mysterious stalker leaving threatening messages in her school locker and mailbox. After taking Otome out to dinner, Tanukichi finds out that she is in love with Anna like him after she reveals her name. However, when she threatens to turn him in, Tanukichi claims to be in love with Ayame instead. The next day, Ayame thinks that Otome could be the stalker after Tanukichi tells her about the situation, but Tanukichi thinks it's someone else entirely. At the student council meeting, Ayame schemes to draw the stalker out of hiding by posing as Anna's boyfriend, while Otome decides to watch Anna with Tanukichi by disguising the two of them. As the plan is launched at a public park, Otome reveals how Anna is her sole reason for painting, as she couldn't imagine anyone else after meeting her. Suddenly, multiple stalkers appear and attack the disguised Ayame. Tanukichi leaps out of cover and defends the girls, but one of the thugs manages to briefly knock him out as he inadvertently kisses Anna. Tanukichi tries to excuse himself but falls unconscious as Anna tries to deal with new, unresolved feelings from the kiss."

		 "After spending time in the hospital following the events at the park, Ayame tells him that she has persuaded Otome to join SOX in hopes of making more risque artwork, even finding ways to draw that the PMs can't detect, but Otome still requires Anna as an inspiration. Tanukichi soon returns to school, but Ayame is strangely absent and Anna keeps avoiding him. Later, Ayame talks about her latest plan to reclaim a hidden stash of old pornographic material located on private property in Yotsuga Forest. She can't do it alone, so instead she plans to lure the students from school out to the forest during the weekend. However, her plans are sidelined when Tanukichi is targeted by a stalker and Anna's mother, Sophia, shows up to the school in person to get the students to support her new legislation that would force all students to wear chastity belt-like devices. Running low on options, Ayame decides to have Tanukichi confront his stalker while Otome hides in a closet to draw lewd pictures herself. However, the stalker turns out to be Anna who restrains and attempts to rape Tanukichi while being unable to understand her feelings. After Ayame accidentally interrupts them, Anna flees as Otome begins furiously drawing the scene with her teeth. Later that night, Hyouka confronts Anna in the lobby of her apartment, asking why her science lab was sterilized without asking. Anna responds that it was done out of love, as the more &quot;impure&quot; influences she eliminates, the more she will be rewarded with love, therefore everything she does for love is just."

		 "For Whom the Dirty Terrorism Benefits?",
		 "Ayame tasks Tanukichi with distributing Otome's new pornographic artwork to the students along with a map to Yotsuga Forest. However, Tanukichi finds himself targeted by an increasingly-obsessive Anna around school, trying to make him drink her &quot;love nectar,&quot; and drink from Tanukichi's. While escaping from Anna, he accidentally drops his bag filled with illegal material in Hyouka's lab and tells Ayame that he can't distribute them with Anna constantly trying to pin him down. On Sunday, the day of the &quot;X Prohibition Law&quot; signature drive, Sophia plans to greet the students of her daughter's academy in person and Ayame plans to quixotically storm the forest against a large force of morality police. Surprisingly, the students all show up at the forest, as Hyouka picked up Tanukichi's material and quietly spread copies around school herself. She manages to distract the police long enough for the female students and SOX to start looking for the hidden stash of porn. However, Anna shows up in person, chasing down Ayame in her Blue Snow disguise. Ayame tosses Tanukichi down into the forest to help him escape from Anna, where he finds the porn stash in a suggestively-shaped cave. However, when he hears Ayame being strangled by Anna, he decides to save her wearing a new disguise he found in the cave. Anna can't understand why the new terrorist gives her similar feelings to Tanukichi, and leaps into the forest in shame. Later that night, Sophia holds a press conference announcing the success of the petition drive, but discovers too late that someone replaced her signed petitions with pornographic artwork, which gets broadcast live around the country and embarrasses her push for the new law."

		 "As Otome's hentai drawings spread around the school, Ayame decides to take the next step and make masturbation aids in the kitchen of the cafe SOX regularly gathers at. Tanukichi is assigned the task of getting Hyouka to develop small vibrators, but upon coming to collect one, a mostly-naked Hyouka attempts to learn about his &quot;cucumber&quot; as payment for her services. While they argue, Anna stops by and starts growing jealous, so Tanukichi quickly hands her a finished vibrating egg without telling her its true purpose to calm her down. The next day, Tanukichi accidentally activates the vibrator with the wireless remote Hyouka gave him, reawakening Anna's lust. Tanukichi tries desperately to escape or find a way to turn off the vibrator, but none of his friends want to help him, and Anna finally traps him inside the Student Council room. Tanukichi discovers that Anna turned the vibrator into a pendant, but is unable to reach it while being pinned down under her. Eventually, the vibrator shorts out as Anna climaxes and Tanukichi manages to escape. Later, Anna overhears Otome make a dirty remark about Tanukichi and starts strangling him while Ayame refuses to help."

		 "What SOX Created",
		 "SOX forms alliances with other erotic terrorist groups throughout Japan to share various pornographic books with each other. Back at school, the student council discovers that someone has been stealing the underwear of girls and boys throughout the city and crediting SOX with the heists. Tanukichi and Ayame watch a girls' changing room to catch a thief, but when Ayame runs off, Anna appears to sexually assault Tanukichi again. Shortly after that, Tanukichi reunites with Ayame only to find her speaking with Hyouka, and confiscates her yaoi book with characters loosely based off himself and Goriki on the cover. Soon, Goriki manages to round up multiple underwear thieves around school, when a mysterious terrorist calling himself &quot;White Peak&quot; of the group &quot;Gathered Fabric&quot; broadcasts his message across school. Back at the cafe, Ayame declares that SOX must take down White Top before his actions undercut the message of SOX. Later that same night, Tanukichi helps a little girl escape the moral police with the help of Hyouka in exchange for turning a blind eye to her yaoi books. The girl then tries to attack Tanukichi until he reveals that he's a member of SOX. The girl reveals herself to be Kosuri Onigashira, and she desperately wishes to join SOX. Ayame is reluctant to trust her, as Kosuri is daughter of Keisuke, another ero-terrorist who made deals with the moral authorities. However, she decides to let Kosuri become a member of SOX, in part because Kosuri's hairstyle reminds her of a penis head."

		 "Tanukichi wakes up to find Kosuri sleeping next to him and Anna dangerously holding a knife in his doorway. He quickly decides to pretend Kosuri is his little sister, but it backfires as Anna threatens to stab her, cutting a large hole in his floor before leaving. Later at school, Anna's father has sent Oboro Tsukimigusa to become the school's Prefect and take charge of the effort to eliminate impure influences in school. However, unlike the moral authorities, Oboro starts by removing mundane items like basketball hoops and volleyball nets as they may somehow lead boys to immoral thoughts. She also tries to confiscate Hyouka's yaoi manga until Hyouka convinces her that it has useful value. Meanwhile, Ayame plans to have SOX distribute Otome's drawings at other schools. Kosuri decides to take charge of the operation herself while Tanukichi convinces Oboro to white-list toilet paper rolls before Anna has an accident. Later, Kosuri returns to report her mission was completely successful, and fueled by her new success, treats Tanukichi like a slave at home. She explains to Tanukichi that she subverted the other school's student council by using her knowledge of shoujo and romantic manga tropes to play the boys and girls off of each other until they all fell under her control. While Tanukichi detests her methods, he can't bring himself to sell Kosuri out to Ayame. The next day, Ayame privately tells Tanukichi that SOX's actions suffered blowback with the sudden appearance of Oboro and her comrades. On top of dealing with the threats of the moral authorities and the Gathered Fabric faction, SOX must also find a way to sabotage the Prefect system before the government exports it to other schools."

		 "Do Androids Dream of Electric Masseurs?",
		 "Ayame launches an operation at school to try and sabotage both the school Prefect program and Gathered Fabric at the same time. First, she uses her Blue Snow persona to spread more lewd drawing materials throughout school while Tanukichi will hang his used boxers to try and attract Gathered Fabric, then take out the underpants thieves to show that SOX does not support them. However, Anna and Oboro come through the door instead. Anna again assaults Tanukichi, and he begs for help from Oboro but she offers none, claiming that even though the act may be immoral, she was trained not to interfere if Anna herself acts immorally. Meanwhile, Kosuri gets jealous that she is left out of the action while Otome uses the time to draw more yaoi artwork. Ayame launches the same plan again, as Tanukichi lies in wait for Gathered Fabric to appear. As Tanukichi manages to knock out several Gathered Fabric members, Kosuri meets with Hyouka to help herself, but Hyouka is not swayed by her usual charm. Elsewhere, Tanukichi subdues another panty thief and immediately steps on the crotch of a second person who stumbled into the same room. However, he discovers that person is Oboro, and that she actually has a penis. Oboro explains that she has been trained to serve Anna and her father for years, to the point that her likes, dislikes, even her gender are whatever Anna's family wants them to be. Suddenly, the fire alarm is pulled and the school evacuates. Back at SOX's hideout, Kosuri takes responsibility for the act, but Ayame scolds her for sabotaging the plan with her own stubbornness. As SOX tries to think of their next move, they receive a message written on a pair of panties to meet at a nearby park, where White Peak himself appears."

		 "As SOX makes negotiations with White Peak to stop hunting down Gathered Fabric members, Their negotiations fall through as Ayame chastises him for using erotic terrorism as a front for the panty thefts. The next morning as Tanukichi rushes to school on a bus due to the broken monorail, Goriki tells him that somebody cut the monorail's power lines, to which he suspects the antics of Gathered Fabric. While talking to Ayame however, Tanukichi and Goriki's bus becomes hijacked by a Gathered Fabric member. Among the jacked buses, Hyouka, Anna and Oboro, and Otome are in separate buses, with White Peak holding Otome's bus hostage. During his bus jacking, White Peak also hijacks the PM systems and proclaims war and his organization as an affiliate with SOX. As Hyouka is interrupted watching the news, she questions the Gathered Fabric member about panties, to which she is threatened by a gun, in which she identifies is a fake. As a result, the jacker is quickly subdued by the bus passengers, and Hyouka receives praise for her actions, although quickly dismissing their words. Meanwhile in Anna and Oboro's bus, as their jacker is collecting everybody's undergarments, Anna single-handedly beats him down, prompting fearful reactions from the male passengers (except for Oboro). On Tanukichi and Goriki's bus, as Goriki is about to give up his undergarments, he causes everybody to vomit in the bus, including the jacker and even the driver who saw him in women's underwear. As Tanukichi escapes, Ayame finds a leak in White Peak's true identity: Takuma Ichinose. She also finds out that there is a real gun among the fakes, to which Hyouka is monitoring. To apprehend Takuma, Ayame has Kosuri gather white panties and lure out Takuma's bus. Despite Tanukichi using musk panties to mask and protect himself, He is overpowered by Takuma, who becomes empowered (and turned on) by the scent. After Ayame intervenes, he is thrown off by Ayame's own scent infused in her panty mask, which allows Tanukichi to restrain him. Before SOX successfully captures him however, Ayame gets kicked out of the bus by Kosuri, prompting the Decency Squad to chase after her. Kosuri reveals she had switched places with the hostage, and joins Gathered Fabric for the sake of war, to which she points a stun gun at Tanukichi."

		 "As Kosuri points her stun gun at Tanukichi, he has no choice but to flee the bus, and he is chased further by the Decency Squad. After Kosuri helps out Takuma, they proceed to take the hostages to Zoshigaoka Academy. After managing to evade the Decency Squad, Tanukichi is approached by Hyouka, who shows him a breaking news story where 39 buses holding 500 hostages are being taken to Zoshigaoka Academy. At the school, the members of Gathered Fabric are making ransom demands with food and drinks as well as new panties, at the cost of provocative images of the students wearing panties on their heads if they fail to comply. As the students put on fresh pairs of panties to mark with their scent, Otome becomes excited at the sight and starts drawing with her mouth, to which she drops her pencil and stumbles across a box of paint. Meanwhile, Ayame and Tanukichi assess the dire situation at hand, to which SOX's blame in this incident will have society see them as criminals, and that the only way to clear SOX's name is to have them capture White Peak, lacking the numbers to do so. As Tanukichi is awkwardly approached again by Hyouka, she explains how people like Anna are brainwashed to believe that anything they do is &quot;righteous&quot; and fall into insanity. Reminded of Anna, Tanukichi devises a risky plan that if successful, can take down Takuma. While Kosuri devises tactics for Gathered Fabric, Takuma reveals that he had no intentions of a revolution or warfare or even wanting to escape. Betrayed, Kosuri tries to immobilize him with her stun gun, which fails due to the wine-stained underwear covering his body from the shock. Later, Otome calls Tanukichi, who manages to escape by drawing 3D perception art of her and the hostages, telling him Takuma's and the other hostages' location. As Tanukichi executes his plan, Takuma is about to receive his third set of panties, until Ayame, Tanukichi, and Anna step in, as well as Goriki and Oboro. Tanukichi reveals that his plan was to get Anna to join forces with SOX, in exchange for his underwear, but has to keep scrubbing the scent off of him so that his cover would not be blown. As Otome helps the students escape using drawings of panties to distract Gathered Fabric members, Ayame and Anna finish off Takuma for good. After Ayame's dirty joke speech to the public, Kosuri returns to SOX, now acknowledging Ayame as her master once more."

		 "The SOX members receive invitations to meet up at a hot springs resort called Health Land in Nukumi, presumably by Sophia Nishikinomiya herself. Tanukichi remembers an artifact passed down to him by his father to be used if he ever travels to Nukumi and decides to take it with him. When they arrive at the resort, they are met by Goriki and Anna who reveal they were invited by Sophia as well. Anna jumps to the thought that her mother reserved the entire resort so that Anna can spend time with Tanukichi, but they all decide to spend time in the baths to wait for Sophia's return. Anna sends Goriki off to fetch something and sexually assaults Tanukichi, but everyone was interrupted by a woman's scream. Everyone finds Sophia's unconscious body in the lockers, where they are confronted by an ero-terrorist called Base Black. Base Black reveals himself to be the one who gathered everyone to the resort and sends them on a brief chase which ends in him retrieving Tanukichi's artifact. Ayame and Tanukichi find him when attempting to fetch their bags for their clothes, which were replaced by black undergarments. He tells that he personally knew Zenjuro and plans to unlock a secret place filled with erotic treasures using the artifact. The others catch up to the scene and Base Black challenges them to a duel for the artifact through Yakyuken. Goriki's loss and subsequent undressing stuns Base Black long enough for Tanukichi to retrieve the artifact, and alongside Ayame are tasked with hiding it deep in the woods while the rest hold off Base Black. They decide to find the treasure instead, but are unable to find an old cable tram to travel up the mountainous area. Hyouka finds them while collecting bugs and helps them locate and power the tram. As Tanukichi and Ayame are riding the tram, Anna appears while climbing the cables to catch up to Tanukichi and causes the floor of the tram to collapse with her falling through. The duo reach an old mansion and explore it, finding a mechanism that the artifact fits through as a wrench. Kosuri and Otome catch up to them and help open the vault containing the treasure - a large number of erotic sculptures and statues. After resealing the vault, the four find Base Black observing them from above, satisfied on how Tanukichi had grown up. The four reunite with Goriki and Anna while Oboro destroys the cable tram. They pledge that one day the treasure will be able to see the world again when the anti-profanity enforcement comes to an end."
