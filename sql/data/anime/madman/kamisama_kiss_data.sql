Tomoe refuses to serve Nanami and leaves in frustration. The next day, Onikiri and Kotetsu, Tomoe's two shrine spirits, tell Nanami all the duties of a Land God which Tomoe previously had to do alone, including keeping written records of human prayers. Onikiri and Kotetsu bring her to the World Over Yonder to see Tomoe, but she decides to leave after hearing him express his disinterest in the shrine.

To make matters worse, Nanami learns that Kurama is a jerk and becomes depressed, much to Tomoe's worry. At lunchtime, Nanami is framed for stealing Kurama's money, until Tomoe makes a grand entrance in front of the other students, clearing her name and serving her lunch.
