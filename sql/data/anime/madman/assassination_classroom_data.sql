A tentacle-d sensei that moves at Mach 20 is out to conquer the classroom after destroying seventy percent of the moon. In addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, the murderous monster behind the lectern will teach his students everything he knows about the assassination game. Should some eager beaver prove to be a quick study in killing, he or she will save Earth from extinction – and collect a hefty reward.

However, none of the students are able to assassinate him due to his Mach 20 speed. Class bully Ryōma Terasaka convinces Nagisa Shiota to wear a grenade filled with pellets. When the creature gets sleepy after assigning the students to write a poem, Terasaka detonates the grenade once Nagisa comes within close range of the creature, but the creature sheds his skin to protect himself and Nagisa from the blast. The creature threatens the other students to refrain from coming up with plans that will harm others. Kaede Kayano names the creature Koro-sensei, seeing him as an &quot;unkillable teacher&quot;."
