		 "Murderous specters may seem like small potatoes compared to Suseri's transferring into Shinichiro and Sakuya's school. However, there may be more to Suseri's presence than at first glance, including the fact that a samurai golem is on the loose with a sword containing a murderous specter and that the opening of so many magical gates is for some reason putting Sakuya under suspicion.

		 "Eye of Truth",
		 "Sakuya is upset by the fact that special investigative teams have been sent by the Shimazu Family to infiltrate the school and who are being picked off one by one by a wall specter summoned by the Western Mage, and even more because Shinichiro can access True Names through kissing, which means he can learn her True Name!

Sakuya finally opens up to him and tells him about her parents &#40especially her father, who was a Western Mage&#41 and about the situation within the Shimazu Family that caused her to leave. A mysterious mirror arrives but turns out to be a magical trap, and Shinichiro and Sakuya must defeat the specter inside the mirror in order to return, but it's using Sakuya's negative feelings against her."

		 "Life in the Shimazu house is back to its usual ridiculous routine, but the new closeness between Shinichiro and Sakuya causes some complications.

While Sakuya and the other fight to revive a fallen Shinichiro, Suseri battles the Western Mage, but is defeated.

Suseri accompanies Shinichiro on a shopping expedition and gets a taste of ordinary life...something she's never experienced before and which everyone else mistakes for a date! Later, Suseri attempts a rite of exorcism against a lightning specter on her own to heighten her powers, but when it goes wrong Shinichiro demands to be allowed to assist her; it is allowed, but on the condition that Shinichiro and Suseri must do it alone. With Shinichiro's help, Suseri both tames the lightning specter and discovers her own path. "

A plan to protect the last spiritual energy stronghold fails. Shinichiro meets Nami, Sakuya's grandmother, who is both not quite as and much more than she appears to be, and learns about both the Asahina Family, the Shimazu Family's greatest rival and Sakuya's father's family, and Isuca's origins.
