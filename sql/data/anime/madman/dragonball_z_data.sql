But quickly stopped by Goku and Krillin's cries for him to defeat Vegeta, Gohan quickly regains some of his consciousness and resumes the fight, pounding on Vegeta. Vegeta is able to cut off Gohan's tail in midair, but as Gohan falls to Earth, he lands on Vegeta and crushes him before finally reverting to his normal form. Vegeta pulls out his remote and summons his spaceship. As he crawls toward it, Krillin attempts to kill him with Yajirobe's sword. Goku tells him to stop, and let Vegeta go. His life spared, Vegeta promises the Z Fighters revenge when he will return as he leaves the Earth in his spaceship for good. The battle with Vegeta is over. "

He overheard Vegeta saying that it was the Nameks who created the Dragon Balls, so they decide to go to the planet Namek. The only problem is that it will take 4339.2516 years to reach Namek. They decide to use Nappa's spaceship, because Saiyan spaceships travel much faster. "
