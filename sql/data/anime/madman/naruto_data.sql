		 "Enter: Naruto Uzumaki",
		 "For the first twelve years of his life, an orphaned boy named Naruto Uzumaki lived a life of enduring the apparent unsolicited hate from a majority of the villagers of the Hidden Leaf Village with a strong ambition to be acknowledged. Caught by Iruka Umino, his teacher, while defacing the Hokage monument, he tells Iruka that he did it for attention and of his dream of becoming a Hokage to win everyone's respect. However, after failing to graduate from the Ninja Academy for the third year in a row for being unable to use the Clone Technique, Naruto is approached by another instructor named Mizuki who tricks him into stealing a scroll of forbidden ninja techniques from the Hokage's residence, with a promise that he would be able to graduate if he was able to learn one of the techniques it contained. After successfully stealing the scroll, Naruto is caught by Iruka, who realises that Naruto had been tricked and protects him from Mizuki, revealed to have been planning to take the scroll for himself. During the ensuing confrontation, Mizuki reveals the fact that Naruto is the host of the Nine-Tails, a fox-like monster that attacked the village twelve years ago and took the life of the Fourth Hokage who managed to seal the Nine-Tails within the newborn Naruto, which he claims is the reason for the hate directed at Naruto. Horrified by this revelation, Naruto runs off and only returns when Iruka, whose parents were killed by the Nine-Tails, refuses to accept Naruto as anything but his student. Touched by his mentor's words, Naruto proceeds to defeat Mizuki using the Multiple Shadow Clone technique he learned from the scroll. Due to the act of saving his life and making an outstanding performance proving him worthy of being a ninja, Iruka allows Naruto to graduate."

		 "During an argument with the Third Hokage over how Naruto wanted to present himself on the photo of Ninja Registration Form, the Hokage is attacked by a small boy, who is revealed to be his grandson Konohamaru Sarutobi. While following Naruto, who is the first person to not see him solely as the Hokage's grandson, Konohamaru asks to be taught the transformation technique that Naruto was using on Hiruzen: the Sexy Technique. In the process, Konohamaru reveals his own reasons for wanting to become Hokage and his desire to be recognised for his own achievements. Eventually, the two are found by Konohamaru's mentor Ebisu, who sees Naruto as a bad influence on Konohamaru, with the resultant confrontation ending after Naruto uses Ebisu's lust against him, by combining his Sexy Technique and the Shadow Clone Technique to produce the overwhelming Harem Technique. Through Naruto's guidance, Konohamaru is able to accept that he cannot follow in his grandfather's footsteps by his name alone."

		 "Once graduated from the Ninja Academy, having drank some milk before meeting up with his former classmates, Naruto is assigned to be a member of a three-person squad before undergoing a test to obtain the rank of Genin. He is put into Team 7, along with Sasuke Uchiha, his long-time rival, and Sakura Haruno, whom he has feelings for though she instead has feelings for Sasuke. Knowing of Sakura's feelings for Sasuke, Naruto formulated a scheme to dispose of his rival and pose as Sasuke to get close to Sakura. But at the last second, Naruto is forced to go to the bathroom while the real Sasuke somehow escapes and runs into Sakura while searching for Naruto. After expressing disgust toward Sakura when she blames Naruto's stupidity on not having parents, Sasuke finds Naruto after he was forced to ditch a guilt-driven Sakura to go to the bathroom again, with their confrontation short-lived. Meanwhile, Naruto's stomach pains are revealed to be the result of drinking long-expired milk earlier, and Hiruzen briefs an unidentified instructor on Naruto and his teammates."

		 "As their classmates gradually all meet up with their Jonin instructors who will decide whether they are fit to become Genin, Team 7 are forced to wait for theirs. Eventually, after Naruto sets up a juvenile trap, he and his group meet their instructor &#58; Kakashi Hatake. Appearing to be a slacker, Kakashi takes the day to let his students each introduce themselves and tell each other their desires and aims &#58; Naruto states that his dream is to become Hokage, Sakura seems to embarrassed by hers to say them publicly, and Sasuke declares his intent to restore his clan by killing an unnamed person. With the introductions over, Kakashi tells Team 7 that their test will begin tomorrow and that they are not to eat before then. The next day, after forcing Team 7 to wait for him again, Kakashi explains that the test entails the seizure of one of two bells from his person, the catch being that only two of the prospective Genin will be able to pass, while the remaining child will be sent back to the Academy. While Sasuke and Sakura hide themselves away as the test begins, Naruto attempts to face Kakashi head-on with his Shadow Clone Technique, which is easily countered, and then falls for a snare trap. Taking advantage of Kakashi lecturing Naruto about falling for obvious traps, Sasuke seemingly takes out the instructor with shuriken and kunai knives."

		 "EAfter his sneak attack failed, Sasuke attempts to fight Kakashi before being buried up to his neck underground. From there, Kakashi subjects Sakura to a genjutsu of Sasuke bleeding to death before dealing with Naruto when he decides to help himself to everyone's lunches. Once the time limit for the test is reached, Naruto is tied to a pole, and Kakashi deems all members of Team 7 utter failures as he reveals that his test was impossible for them, due to their lack of teamwork during the exercise. From there, Kakashi explains the essential need for ninja groups to work as a unit, as well as stating his own ideal that, while ninja who break the rules are scum, those who abandon their friends are worse than scum. From there, Kakashi offers to give Team 7 one final chance and leaves them with a single order to follow: not to feed Naruto. However, knowing that they need Naruto at full strength for what Kakashi has in store for a make-up test, Sasuke and Sakura feed Naruto. Having watched the entire event, Kakashi dramatically appears before them. As Kakashi apparently prepares to punish them all, Sakura stands up to him, explaining that they gave Naruto food because he's a member of their team. Ultimately, finding a group who actually met his test's standards, Kakashi decides that Team 7 pass his test and accepts them as his students."

However, on their way there, Team 7 is ambushed by the Demon Brothers, two Chunin from the Hidden Mist Village in the Land of Water. Though it appeared they killed him as they go after Team 7 and Tazuna, the Demon Brothers learned that Kakashi was aware of their presence and faked his death to catch them off-guard and see his students in action. While applauding Sasuke for holding off the Demon Brothers and Sakura for guarding Tazuna, Kakashi expresses disappointment in how poorly Naruto handled the situation and got himself poisoned. However, Naruto refuses to quit the mission, and with Sasuke's taunting getting to him, uses a kunai to stab his hand to bleed out the poison while making a promise to never back down again. Though Kakashi decides to have Naruto's self-inflicted wound dealt with, he is amazed by the boy's rapid healing and wonders if it is the Nine-Tails's doing. Elsewhere, a man named Gato confronts the Demon Brothers' boss for his subordinates' failure to assassinate Tazuna. Threatening Gato with his large sword, the figure decides to handle the job personally."

Tazuna then explains that the man torn from the picture, named Kaiza, was once a hero in the Land of Waves whom Inari looked up to.
