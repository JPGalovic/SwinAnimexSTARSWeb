		 "The episode opens with Nic watching as Alex is berated by Barry, her boss, for not earning enough money. Later, while Nic and Worick are dealing with some thugs, they see her being abused by an irate customer. As she walks away, one of them &#40later revealed to be Nic&#41; tosses her a handkerchief to wipe blood off her face. The two Handymen then meet up with the police officer Chad, who hires them to eliminate Barry's gang, which has been encroaching on mafia turf. Before they leave, Nic asks if they can take a trophy. Worick then meets up with Alex, who asks him to thank Nic for the handkerchief, and Worick tells her that they have been hired to kill her boss. Nic is then seen attacking the gang, and Worick shows up in time to finish off Barry. Alex shows up and takes Worick's gun, firing several shots into Barry's body in a fit of despair as she's relieved to no longer be under his control but is now rudderless. Speaking with Chad afterward, Worick reveals that they have chosen Alex as their trophy. Chad protests, but Nic cows him into acceptance with a display of his superhuman strength. At the end of the episode, Worick asks Alex if she can answer their phone for them while he is out. "

Meanwhile, the Tag and some other men are pressuring Dr. Theo to join their organization. They begin to threaten Nina, and are surprised when she arrives unharmed with Nic. Nic and the Tag then begin to fight, with Nic claiming that he can take him down in three minutes. Worick begins to explain the concept of Tags to Alex, but they are interrupted by Nic's fight as he defeats his rival. Afterward, Chad arrives, and berates them for the problems they have caused. Alex asks Nina if she is afraid of Nic, and Nina says she is not: She says Alex is because she doesn't know about Twilights. Elsewhere, the wounded Twilight that Nic fought is killed by an unknown person for failing to complete his job. "

		 "The episode begins with a flashback to young Worick with a client, juxtaposed with a newscaster talking about the state of affairs in Ergastulum and the Three Laws which are about to take effect. Worick runs back to Nic to share his earnings and to tell him about a caf√© that serves Twilights where they can eat, but is stunned to find Nic crouched and bleeding in an alley. Chad tends to Nic's wounds. In the present, Ginger, assistant to Gina Paulklee of the Paulklee Guild, reports to her boss that Doug has taken a job outside of the Guild's jurisdiction.

Monroe recalls an attack by a C/3 Twilight (possibly a young Nic) who destroyed his estate and decimated his staff. Worick reports that the Corsicans are making a move. Delico, Monroe's D/0 Twilight, saves Monroe from Doug. Worick tries to stop Nic to keep him from overextending himself, but before he can, Ginger and Gina show up. Gina explains to Nic that the Three Laws have to be observed or Ergastulum will fall apart. She shoots Nic and Doug with Celebrer &quot;downers&quot;. Alex, who was studying the sign language book and watching the rain, sees a shadowy figure, which is revealed to be Barry. The sound of heavy footsteps on the stairs has her cowering on the floor wondering how it could be that he survived being shot.

Monroe holds a funeral for the men killed by Doug. Meanwhile, Nina and Worick discuss Nic's injuries as he lies unconscious at the clinic. When Nic awakens, Worick tells him that the body dump discovered in episode four were all Twilights; one of them was the Tag that Nic had fought in episode two. When Worick returns to the office, he finds Dr. Theo there; Theo tells him that Alex is likely suffering from withdrawal from drugs given to her by Barry, which have caused her hallucinations.

		 "Worick wakes up from a dream about the time that he learned that Nic is a Twilight, and Alex comforts him.

Nic is about to kill himself too, but Worick forcibly stops him, telling him that he will have to suffer for what he did before he lets him die.
