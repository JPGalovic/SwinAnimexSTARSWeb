		 "Outside the grounds of his high school, Light Yagami discovers a notebook that claims to be able to kill anyone whose name and face is known to its owner. He initially dismisses the so-called &quot;Death Note&quot; as a hoax, but, after testing its powers, he discovers that these claims are indeed real. The original owner, a shinigami named Ryuk, approaches Light and explains that the notebook now belongs to him. Since Light is the new owner, he is the only one who can see and interact with Ryuk. The shinigami also says that when Light's time to die comes, Ryuk will be the one to write down his name in his book. Light decides to use the Death Note's power to rid the world of evil and become the god of a new, peaceful world. "

Because the police officer in charge of the Kira case, Soichiro Yagami, is Light's father, Light can monitor the authorities' movements. Meanwhile, Ryuk tells Light that he is being followed. He also explains that not only do shinigami get the lifespans of people they have taken before their time, their eyes can see everyone's name and lifespan floating above their heads.

		 "Mikami's Death Note fails to work and Near confesses that he knew about the fake notebook and had actually tampered with the real one. Mikami is restrained and, faced with Near's undeniable evidence, Light breaks down and laughs like a madman. He confesses that he is Kira and attempts to write names down on a piece of the Death Note hidden in his watch. Matsuda keeps him from doing so by shooting him down. Seeing Light writhe on the floor in agony, Mikami kills himself. Wounded, Light escapes in the middle of the commotion. He goes over everything that has happened in a series of flashbacks. As he had promised in the beginning of the series, Ryuk writes down Light's name in his notebook, thinking that this whole experience has been quite fun. Ryuk is shown standing on top of a skyscraper, before Light finally dies of cardiac arrest on a set of stairs, seeing L's figure in front of him. "
