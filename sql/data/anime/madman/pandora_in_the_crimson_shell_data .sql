		 "In an age of advanced technology, a cyborg named Nene Nanakorobi meets an inventor named Uzal Delilah and her cyborg pet, Clarion, on their way to Cenancle Island. Shortly after the girls arrive on the island, the city comes under attack by an army of robots controlled by a group of rebels who despise Uzal. In order to battle against them, Uzal gives Nene authority to use the Pandora Device inside of Clarion, updating her operating system to temporarily give her the skill to use a gun. After the robots are stopped, Uzal brings Nene to her laboratory where she gives Nene an optical camouflage for when she uses the Pandora Device, before the rebels ask for Uzal's help in stopping a robot that had gone berserk.

After the underlings trick BUER into firing its laser cannon, Clarion aims to reach its main console while Nene acts as her bodyguard. However, a large piece of rubble interrupts Clarion before she complete her mission, so she instead operates some smaller robots to allow Nene to reach the console and shut BUER down. With forces approaching on the laboratory, Uzal detaches BUER's Central Nervous Unit before having Nene and the others escape from the lab as it self-destructs, leaving Clarion in Nene's care. Upon reaching the surface, Nene and the others find themselves surrounded by Cenancle's Defense Force."

The next day, Nene and Clarion are approached by one of Uzal's underlings, Bunny, who asks for BUER's authentication key in order to help her comrades.

When some thugs suddenly show up and start wrecking the place, Nene and Clarion step up against them, encouraging the other volunteers to stand up against them too.
