In the process, Gerd is injured and paralyzed from his waist down. Gerd is disillusioned when he discovers that he is being dropped from the team and Igor will take his place. Some time later, a mysterious doctor, Beatrice Grese, offers Gerd an experimental drug. During an XAT-led operation to track down a Demoniac hiding in an industrial complex, a Blassreiter appears and destroys the Demoniac. XAT officers Hermann Saltza and Amanda Werner are shocked to see the Blassreiter transform into Gerd who has fully recovered his ability to walk.

At the time, Sasha was carrying out bio-engineering research at the university with nanomachines to overcome disease. To help the immigrant refugees displaced by the flood, Xargin and Joseph broke into the university for medicine, but were caught by the guards. Sasha negotiated with director Victor Stachus to have them released. After Sasha's apparent death by anti-Outsider hooligans and the deaths of Outsider children due to lack of medicine, Joseph learned that Victor was using her research to create living weapons.
