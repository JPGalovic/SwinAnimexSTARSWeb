		 "The Girl at the Eiffel Tower",
		 "It is the first day of the Paris World Exposition in 1889. 14-year-old Jean Rocque Raltique, a brilliant young inventor, arrives at the fair to participate in a flying contest with his uncle. He is distracted, however, when he notices a 14-year-old mysterious dark-skinned girl pass by on a bicycle. Jean follows the girl, known as Nadia, to the Eiffel Tower and tries to make friends with her, but she acts cold and aloof. Just then, three bandits -- 28-year-old Grandis Granva, a fiery-tempered woman and her two 27-year-old sidekicks, vain, arrogant Sanson, and pudgy, nerdy Hanson -- appear and attempt to kidnap Nadia, but she escapes. Jean later finds Nadia performing at a circus across town and is instantly smitten with her performance. At the end of the show, the Grandis gang appear and take Nadia from her (unsympathetic) ringmaster through bribery and pretending to be her sister. After a wild chase, Jean rescues Nadia and earns her trust. Learning she has no place to go, he decides to take his new friend to his home in Le Havre."

He takes Nadia to his aunt's house in Le Havre, but his grumpy, dour Auntie refuses to take Nadia in. Jean decides to take Nadia to his workshop in Le Havre, and she spends the night there. All the while, Jean learns from Nadia that she wishes to return to the country where she was born. Unfortunately, she has no idea where it is, but her pet lion King suspects it might be in Africa. Jean decides to take Nadia there himself using his all-new aircraft, and they make yet another escape from the Grandis gang. They do not get far, however, when the plane engine falters and the crafts plummets into the ocean."

Its captain, Melville, and his first mate Holland, are on the trail of a supposed &quot;sea monster&quot; responsible for sinking countless ships in the Pacific Ocean. Jean is intrigued to be aboard the vessel, but Nadia is gravely suspicious. While on the ship, they also meet Ayerton Grenavan, a flamboyant &quot;scientist&quot; who claims to be funding the pursuit.

The children are kept aboard the submarine for three days while Nemo and his command crew pursue an enemy submarine (the same &quot;sea monster&quot; that wrecked the Abraham). Eventually, Jean, Nadia, and King are released from the submarine and they set off into the sky on Jean's newly revamped aircraft.

Soon the children are forced to flee from the same soldiers. Marie takes her new &quot;guardians&quot; to a secluded cave containing blankets and supplies. That night, Jean and Nadia bury Marie's fallen parents and tearfully confess to the latter that her parents are dead. Meanwhile, the Grandis gang, having washed up on the island themselves, are taken captive by the soldiers and taken to a shadowy base where they are questioned by the soldiers' commander about the Blue Water, Nadia's pendant."

The next day, Marie and King wander outside the cave to collect flowers (Jean and Nadia debating about their next move -- should they rescue the people on the island or not?) and are captured by the soldiers. Jean and Nadia follow them to the crater and find themselves in a complex of factories, where the villagers are forced to work as slaves. They also recognize the &quot;sea monster&quot; as another submarine, known as the Garfish, operated by the soldiers' ruthless ringleader, Gargoyle. While Gargoyle investigates a powerful artifact needed to complete his secret weapon, Nadia's Blue Water is accidentally set off, forcing the children to escape from the factories. To save Jean from being killed, Nadia gives him the Blue Water and turns herself in. Jean promises to rescue her."

He demands his captive to reveal the whereabouts of the Blue Water. When Nadia refuses to obey, Gargoyle threatens to kill both Marie and King. With no choice, Nadia reluctantly admits that Jean has it. The soldiers begin to search the complex for Jean, while the Grandis gang decides to escape. Both sides inadvertently come across each other when they board a freight train bound for Gargoyle's castle. Gargoyle tours Nadia around the compound and introduces its center — a spiral tower known as Babel, which can obliterate anything in its path. That evening he forces Nadia to witness the tower's awesome powers as it demolishes an island in the distance. Out at sea, Captain Nemo sees the same explosion and declares that Gargoyle has &quot;finally released the great abomination.&quot;"

Grandis catches a cold and is treated by the doctor. When Captain Nemo and Electra stop by medical bay to check on the sick patient, Grandis falls hopelessly in love with Nemo… much to the dismay of Sanson and Hanson. Later, Nemo crosses paths with Nadia for the first time and acts quite surprised when he sees her… and her Blue Water.

The submarine is surrounded on all sides by a field of mines, which can be triggered should the underwater current shifts or if the submarine dares to move. In a race against time, Grandis, Sanson, and Hanson propose to use their Gratan to take out three of the mines so that the Nautilus can safely escape from Gargoyle's trap. However, Sanson knocks Grandis out, fearing for her safety. He and Hanson set aboard the Gratan and begin their mission, but the tank begins to malfunction. Jean, who has sneaked aboard the tank, helps the pair as best as he can, but soon the Gratan's underwater camera shatters, leaving the Gratan blind. With Grandis communicating from the Nautilus bridge, the trio barely manages to succeed and save the submarine from a deadly fate."

Grandis tries to impress Nemo by cooking a (rather ugly) platter of fish, but things don't go as she expects. Later, King snatches Grandis' own dinner and there is a wild chase which results with King ending up in the Nautilus's forbidden engine room. When Jean retrieves him, Nemo explains that the Nautilus is powered by a particle annihilation engine that could potentially take them up to the stars… but also destroy the world if used improperly."

Humorous complications ensue as Jean accidentally stumbles into Nadia changing into her swimsuit (but they later go on a walk on the beach), Grandis and Electra get into a jealous rivalry for Nemo's love, while Nemo remains oblivious. While Jean goes off on a hunting expedition with Sanson and the others, Nadia bonds with Grandis as the latter explains about a tragic past. As a child, Grandis had grown into a wealthy family and was courted by a handsome man who turned out to be a swindler. She subsequently became obsessed with jewels, which explains why she was chasing after Nadia's Blue Water. But now that she has met Captain Nemo, she no longer sees Nadia's jewel as valuable. That night, the hunting party returns and Sanson throws down the main catch -- a murdered baby deer. Nadia is quite upset about this and leaves the camp."

Together with King, Marie frolics around the island until she gets hopelessly lost -- and far away from camp. They soon discover that Neo-Atlanteans are also at the island and are chased. Marie and King become separated during this adventure. Pursued by a monstrous robotic giant with a mechanical claw, Marie is rescued by Sanson and they struggle to outrun the giant. After a thrilling chase on a mine cart, the pair barely returns to camp unscathed. The walker crashes after them and its pilot emerges from the cockpit, threatening to kill everyone. When the soldier almost shoots Nadia, Nemo takes his revolver and takes him down. Nadia is furious with Nemo for doing so, despite the latter insisting that a soldier was aiming at her."

Accompanied by Nemo, Jean, Sanson, Hanson, and King set off into a dangerous trek through the underwater domain of Reef 64. They find the herb in a cave situation on the opposite side of a cliff face. On their way back, however, they are attacked by a monstrous eel called a &quot;Dinicthys.&quot; Jean and King bravely attempt to draw the Dinicthys away from their position by throwing their diving suits' lights into a void.

A Garfish rams into its side, only to have its nose crippled, and the submarine drifts away, exploding. When the Nautilus attempts to surface, it is surrounded by the American fleet, commanded by vengeful Captain Melville, who has received an anonymous tip that the submarine is responsible for sinking the ships. (Naturally, the &quot;source&quot; of this information is Gargoyle.) The subsequent damage causes the Nautilus to drift to the bottom of the ocean. Because the American fleet wants to see them destroyed, the Nautilus is forced to stay underwater until the fleet departs. Prior to this, a genial sailor named Ensign Fait gives Jean a bouquet of manmade flowers to offer as a present to Nadia, but she rudely turns it down (it reminds her of the flowers from Gargoyle's garden). In the aftermath of the attack, Fait is trapped inside an engine room poisoned by leaking gas, but Nemo orders the room sealed off so as to prevent further damage. Jean is crushed beyond grief as he painfully listens to his new friend die."

On the way, Nadia begins to question everything that has happened and wonders why she was chosen to wield the Blue Water. Jean learns from Sonar Officer Eiko that the latter was a survivor on a French ship which was sunk by the Garfish. The boy is traumatically shocked when he adds that its captain is none other than his missing father. As the coffins are prepared for burial, Jean wanders off alone and throws away his wrench, deciding that he no longer wishes to invent if technology is so dangerous. Nadia is sad to see him so gloomy and tries to cheer him up. She succeeds by reminding him of the promise he made to her when they were in France. The episode ends when Fait and his comrades are laid to rest in the soil, with Nadia crying on Jean's shoulder."

Jean is at a loss, until Nadia offers that she has interest in flying again… &quot;only in a craft built by Jean.&quot; Inspired, Jean decides to build another aircraft. He aspires to do so all by himself without the help of any grown-ups… a task that he finds more difficult than he anticipated when he can't get an engine to work. Even so, he refuses help from Hanson, straining his friendship with the latter. Later, however, Jean has a change of heart and decides to ask Hanson for help on making the finest aircraft he can. The aircraft is completed, and Jean takes Nadia on a joyous flight above the clouds. In doing so, he manages to impress Nadia and reassure her that he will get her to Africa someday."

The passengers are mortified by the thought, especially Sanson, who goes into an exaggerated tirade on what an unstably icy place Antarctica really is. Jean, however, is quite excited by the idea of traveling to a new place. When the submarine arrives at Antarctica, an ancient &quot;shellfish&quot; squid latches onto the Nautilus and threatens to destroy it. The Nautilus attempts to get rid of it by ramming into an iceberg, to no avail. They finally succeed in losing their menace by steering toward an explosive underwater volcano. Unable to endure the excruciating heat, the shellfish lets go and drifts away. The Nautilus then travels through a tunnel to its subterranean base. "

But the most spectacular sight of all is a massive (and ancient) whale named Irion, who happens to be close friends with Nemo. When Nadia speaks to the whale, he reveals that the latter will soon find her father… as well as her own brother.

Unfortunately, during the test flight, the engine backfires and the glider spirals out of control, finally exploding in the sky. The crew panics, fearing that Gargoyle will probably discover them because of this incident. Sure enough, they are proven right, because Nemo and the others are forced to take down more Garfish submarines. Afterwards, Nemo warns Jean to be more careful with his inventions. Nadia is infuriated to see Jean take Nemo's reprimand without the slightest impulse to stand up for himself, but she goes too far in trying to stand up for him and is slapped by Nemo, especially when she insults him and his crew. Furthermore, Nadia's burgeoning jealousy over Jean's friendship with Electra intensifies… until she finally learns from the latter that she is in no danger of losing Jean. Electra only considers Jean like a little brother she once lost years ago to an attack by an evil man. Nadia recognizes the murderer as Gargoyle, and begins to realize the error of her misjudgment."

But Gargoyle springs his newest ace: a super-charged, magnetic weapon called &quot;SeaNet Beam Gun.&quot; With excruciating power it literally drags the Nautilus out of the ocean and draws it inexorably toward Gargoyle's Neo-Atlantean battleship in the sky. Then the Nautilus takes devastating damage from the battleship's &quot;atomic vibrator&quot;, which all but compromises the submarine's power. Electra suggests self-destructing the Nautilus so as to take them all down with Gargoyle, but Grandis objects, stating that the &quot;real&quot; reason she's doing so is because she &quot;wants to die with Captain Nemo because you know he will never love you!&quot; The Grandis gang pretends to make a getaway in the Gratan but actually perform another heroic rescue by compromising the battleship's missile tube by blasting one of its annihilation bombs just before it hits the Nautilus. Furthermore, Jean rescues Nadia (again) when the latter unwisely tries to surrender herself to Gargoyle (in order to stop the fighting) by using his spare glider. Then the Nautilus engineers manually launch their last missile, which destroys Gargoyle's deadly weapon. The compromised submarine splashes into the ocean and disappears underwater into a whirlpool.

To save the children, Nemo relocates them to his personal cabin, warning that they will be jettisoned from the doomed Nautilus. Returning to the bridge, Nemo is confronted at gunpoint by Electra, who shoots his arm. Trapped in the cabin, Jean and Nadia listen in shock as Electra describes her tragic past. Thirteen years ago in the kingdom of Tartessos, Nemo's wife, the Queen, was killed in an attack by ruthless rebels led by Gargoyle and his puppet liege, Emperor Neo. Gargoyle attempted to unlock the Tower of Babel's ancient power, but Nemo put a stop to it by removing the Blue Water from its control device. The tower self-destructed and washed away all of Tartessos in seven days. Electra also lost her parents and little brother. Two nights later she was rescued by Nemo. She gradually fell in love with him… until she learned that the latter was responsible for the destruction of Tartessos and the deaths of the innocent people who lived there. Despite her grudge, however, Electra remained loyal to Nemo in mutual understanding of his goal to take down Neo-Atlantis. However, she admits that she was also jealous of Nadia, fearing that the latter would &quot;steal Nemo's heart&quot; away. It is at this point that Nadia realizes that Nemo is actually her father, much to her shock, and she begins to regret the way she treated him. Angry that Nemo has supposedly &quot;gone back to being an ordinary father&quot; and not sacrificing himself to stop Gargoyle, Electra has lost control and attempts to shoot Nemo again. But Nemo admits that he is merely fighting to atone for his sins and that he couldn't self-destruct the Nautilus because he cares about Electra and doesn't want to her to suffer the same fate. Ashamed and humiliated, Electra attempts to shoot herself, but Nemo stops her. He then releases the children from the crippled Nautilus, saying &quot;Live, Nadia! Live!&quot; "

Just then, a mysterious force field snags the tank in mid-air and lands them safely on the ground. Their rescuer turns out to be none other than Electra, who informs them that Captain Nemo is still alive and well. She takes the companions aboard New Nautilus, a super-charged massive battleship with powerful electromagnetic turrets. However, the confrontation between Nemo and Gargoyle does not go well, and results with the captain reluctantly surrendering his own Blue Water to his enemy. Gargoyle then destroys Tartessos with a powerful blast and takes Nadia into the skies. "

		 "Nadia is brought aboard Red Noah again, this time as it hovers in the sky, dwarfing even Gargoyle's battleships. There Gargoyle shows Nadia the ancient history of Atlantis, including an experimental massive &quot;human&quot; called Adam, and failed creations hovering in jars. She also meets Emperor Neo, who turns out to be none other than her long-lost brother -- a mechanical puppet under Gargoyle's control. Meanwhile, the New Nautilus has survived the destruction of Tartessos and sets off to fight back. Neo threatens the people around the world to surrender England, but just as the weapon fires, the New Nautilus intervenes, and the two crafts are face to face. "

		 "Both Red Noah and New Nautilus exchange laser fire and turret blasts in the sky. The subsequent battle causes much damage to the streets of Paris, destroying the Eiffel Tower. Eventually both crafts elevate to outer space. However, New Nautilus cannot take down Red Noah because the latter's powerful force field is still intact. Breaching a hole in Red Noah 's defenses, the Nautilus sends the Gratan into Red Noah. Grandis, Sanson, and Hanson traverse through the spaceship's corridors, cutting holes in the bulkheads with the tank's newly installed laser turrets. After a long chase they discover Red Noah 's power plant and sacrifice the Gratan to take down Red Noah 's barrier. New Nautilus breaches Red Noah, and Nemo, Electra, and Jean confront Gargoyle in a massive, observatory like chamber. Standing on pedestals more than two meters wide and a hundred meters above the floor, the trio is horrified to discover that Nadia is now under Gargoyle's control. "

		 "Successor to the Stars",
		 "Both Neo and Nadia shoot Nemo, wounding him. Electra radios the New Nautilus to blast through the throne room. The subsequent explosion compromises Gargoyle's hold on Neo, who recognizes his father. Using his powers, Neo returns the Blue Waters to their rightful owners and approaches Nadia in order to break the crown that is controlling her mind. Just when he reaches the throne, however, he freezes -- Gargoyle has unplugged his source of energy. Using all his will, Neo breaks through and succeeds in freeing his sister. In doing so, he sacrifices himself. Then Gargoyle tortures Electra with deadly volts and causes Jean to fall to his death. The New Nautilus breaches the throne room and blasts at Gargoyle. Nemo gives Nadia his own Blue Water and explains that she can revive Jean if she prays to the Blue Water. With encouragement from Grandis and Electra, Nadia combines both Blue Waters, and its powers form a sphere of light. Ignoring Nemo's warning that only an Atlantean can withstand the power of the Blue Water, Gargoyle staggers toward the sphere and touches it… and his own being literally turns into salt and disintegrates -- he was a human being all along. Nadia successfully brings Jean back to life. Nemo then sacrifices himself to destroy Red Noah as the companions return to Earth aboard an all new submarine spaceship. 12 years later in 1902, a 17-year-old Marie talks about how the companions have gone their separate ways: Grandis is single, Hanson a wealthy businessman, Electra a mother, and Jean and Nadia are happily married. Meanwhile, Marie has married Sanson and is expecting her firstborn child."
