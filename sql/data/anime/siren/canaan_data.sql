		 "UA: Experimental virus thought to be developed by the CIA, its name taken from the Swahili word for &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;flower&quot;. Exposure to UA usually results in death within 12 hours from severe bleeding. There is no known cure, though clandestine organisations are working on an anti-virus. Survivors of the virus are known as Borners and are left with permanent blood vessel patterns on the skin resembling spidery flowers. Canaan is a war orphan from the Middle East, rescued from the ruins of her war-torn village and raised by an ex-mercenary named Sham. Gifted with synaesthesia (a rare condition in which the body's senses trigger visual patterns), Canaan's life is set for revenge when Sham is murdered by Alphard - the leader of a bio-terrorism organisation known as Snake, who have claimed responsibility for UA attacks on China and Japan. Close to obtaining the only known anti-virus to UA and wishing to profit from its possession, Alphard's only obstacle is a woman from her past known as Canaan... An explosive anime thriller set in the marketplaces and remote countryside of China, Canaan is an incendiary conspiracy story directed by Masahiro Ando (Full Metal Alchemist, Cowboy Bebop, Sword of the Stranger) and animated by P.A. Works (Afro Samurai: Resurrection, Angel Beats!).",

		 "Maria Ōsawa and Minoru Minorikawa are dispatched to Shanghai from Japan, two years after the events of 428: Shibuya Scramble, to cover the upcoming International Anti-Terrorism Conference in the city with various world leaders coming to attend the meeting. Canaan, a Middle Eastern teenaged mercenary, was in the city as well after meeting with the unknown female contact with information that her rival Alphard Al Sheya was captured and secretly detained in Karachi, Pakistan by covert operators of the CIA's Special Activities Division. When Maria comes to see an unknown man dead with the Ua virus, Canaan saves her from being assassinated by masked gunmen before she defeats the rest of them without alerting and panicking the public with heightened senses in synesthesia. Meanwhile, the CIA's SAD convoy comes under attack from an IED ambush while transporting Alphard in their custody."

Minoru, in a flashback, remembers that his superiors requested him to train Maria in order to become a professional photographer after surviving the events in Shibuya. While eating dinner in Shanghai, Maria and Minoru are targeted by an unknown old man who resembled the official Minoru saw on television en route to the city. Canaan arrives on the scene to save the two reporters from the Mini-Uzi-wielding man, before she was targeted for death by the man himself. He then dies by electrocution. The two reporters were later kicked out of their hotel room due to the mess created by unknown men. Minoru later contemplated about the mysterious T-shaped purple mark he saw from the old man and a corpse found from the festival he visited a day earlier."

Meanwhile, Alphard began to make plans for an unknown event while Liang Qi is irritated over Alphard's ignorance for her to attack Canaan right away. Canaan later was able to visit Maria with the help of her synesthesia-based abilities despite that she and Minoru were forced to stay in a run-down apartment. Maria and Canaan later decide to take a tour around Shanghai, the two of them visiting the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel when Canaan was lured away from the tram to check on a supposed trap before running back to see Maria missing. Canaan fights against a young boy who told her that he is a Borner due to his mysterious ability after being infected with the Ua virus, which in case gave him the ability to hide in narrow passages. Canaan killed him with a well-placed shot in the body to obtain the detonator for the explosive placed on Maria's head after she was restrained."

Maria later has PTSD over the events of her detention and rescue by Canaan, not knowing that Canaan is really an armed mercenary and assassin for real and not the girl she knew from years ago. Alphard, with Liang Qi and Cummings, attend a public function dedicated to the upcoming NBCR International Anti-Terrorism Conference with the selection of the Daedala Corporation, a Private military company that has the Chinese government as its major client to assist Chinese security forces in safeguarding diplomats for the upcoming conference with Cummings as the public head of the company. In a public toilet, Canaan confronts Alphard privately with the latter taunting her for her failure to protect Siam from getting killed years ago.

Maria and Minoru later investigate the T-shaped marks with the assistance of Japanese physicians back in Japan to study them and find out what has caused them for themselves. Canaan later meets Yunyun embarrassingly as part of the latter's mission is to get rid of her. Despite pleas from Maria, Canaan and Yunyun continue to face off against each other unsuccessfully with a plan by Yunyun to kill herself and Canaan with dynamite mounted throughout her entire body before Canaan decides to save the girl out of pity for Maria since she is her only friend. Back in Maria and Minoru's rented apartment room, Yunyun confesses to her true state as a Borner, but without any kind of special abilities granted to her by the Ua virus' infection since it merely gave her two appendixes. Minoru later pays him with money to help her be a double agent to both him and the Snakes as his personal informant. "

Minoru later meets with Hakko, one of the employees of the bar he visited revealed to the reporter his suspicions that she was a Borner. The NBCR Anti-Terrorism Conference was now underway with armed Daedala PMCs protecting the dignitaries in the Shanghai International Conference Hall with armed policemen of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security. Liang Qi later perpetrates the bombing of the hall's interior after the American President concluded his speech. Canaan and Minoru head to the hall themselves to secure Maria themselves after hearing the bombings. Armed Public Security policemen later confronted Daedala contractors when they, later with Alphard, attacked the officers when they were trying to get to the building's central control room. Maria is detained by Daedala forces under Liang Qi's instruction to lure Canaan in and kill her. But remembering the words taught to her by Siam in her youth, Alphard shoots Liang Qi to prevent her from further attacking Maria.

Kenji Ōsawa, head of Okashi Pharmaceutical, had planned to send the anti-Ua virus vaccine to Shanghai when he was supposedly killed in a car bomb. This "event" forced the American military to send in B-2 bombers from Guam to bomb the entire Shanghai International Conference Hall in order to purge the Ua virus in flames and prevent in from spreading throughout Shanghai. Canaan infiltrates the hall, rescuing Maria after fending off several Daedala security forces personnel impending her progress. Canaan and Yuri Natsume worked together to hack the B-2's GPS system and let the bombs miss the conference hall to save the dignitaries inside while heavily armed PLA Special Operations Forces troopers escorted Kenji safely at the outskirts of the hall. Alphard and Cummings retreat underground with a handful of Daedala security forces, the former already deciding to abandon Liang Qi to let her fend for herself.

During a public concert, Hakko showed off her Borner ability with people having severe headaches without them being aware. It later forced Canaan and Maria to flee as Hakko had nightmares of how she first knew of her ability from being infected with the Ua virus. Minoru later confronts Santana, Hakko's &quot;guardian&quot;, over the nature of the Borners and the Ua virus. Canaan and Maria later go on a long cruise with Santana, Minoru and Hakko in a SUV that took them to the desert regions of China. Maria and Canaan later talked about being together and reaffirming their friendship since it helped them over problems they had such as Canaan's inability to see colors from her synesthesia or from Maria having Canaan by her side all the way, straining the two of them in potential danger. Hakko tries to strangle Canaan in her sleep, remarking to the mercenary that it was her fault. The group later encounters Yunyun, traveling on a bicycle."

A Snake chopper under Liang Qi's control ambushed Canaan when she targeted her by firing rockets, temporarily sealing her in rubble with Alphard encountering the mercenary.

Canaan decides to go back to the factory one more time, promising to find Hakko. Back in the Factory, Liang Qi grows increasingly unstable as Alphard and Cummings try to deal with her, and ultimately has to be killed after she takes a dose of the Ua virus in a mad bid for Alphard's attention with horrific results due to her not having the necessary genetics for synaesthesia. Meanwhile, a covert American task force known as Task Force 124 is deployed from Afghanistan, with orders to take down the Factory. While the bombers are on their way, Canaan fights off the advance of Delta Force operators already in the Factory while the PLA was deployed to the Factory.
