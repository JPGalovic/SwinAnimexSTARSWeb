		 "In the small town of Suiten, three boys discover they can transfer their souls to a parallel world. Each had traumatic childhood experiences… Taro Komori – haunted by the death of his sister. Makoto Ogami – traumatised by his father’s suicide. Masayuki Nakajima - tormented by the suicide of a classmate he once bullied. Together they attempt to unravel the mysteries of their outer-body experiences and gain new perspectives on their unusual lives as they grow towards adulthood and attempt to reconcile with the darkness of their collective past. When ‘ghosts’ from their unseen world manifest in their apparent ‘reality’, their lives reveal further mystery... Ghost Hound is the story of seemingly mismatched children struggling to find the truth that has been absent from their lives - from the remnants of their damaged past, to overcoming rural isolation, the ennui of adolescence and the mysteries of their seemingly paranormal childhood. A unique and strangely immersive piece of anime carrying an eerie, dream-like atmosphere with ethereal psychedelic animation reminiscent of similar work on last year’s Genius Party compilations. The experimental soundtrack lifts the intent and tone of the series and firmly establishes Ghost Hound as a work of the avant-garde.",
