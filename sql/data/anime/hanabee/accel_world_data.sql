		 "Haruyuki 'Haru' Arita is a short, overweight boy with low self-esteem due to frequent ridicule by bullies at Umesato Junior High School led by a guy named Araya. To vent his frustration, he resorts to playing squash in the school's virtual world network where he always gets the highest scores. Haruyuki's childhood friend, Chiyuri Kurashima offers to have lunch and suggests that he report the delinquents to the school board, but he rejects her pity, knocking her lunch basket to the ground. Later, on returning to play squash, he discovers that his highest score was beaten by Kuroyukihime, the Student Council Vice-President, who invites him to lunch the following day. Haruyuki meets with Kuroyukihime, who offers to cable with him, shocking the other upperclassmen. She then transfers a program called Brain Burst to him. After it successfully installs, Araya shows up and Kuroyukihime provokes him into punching Haruyuki at which point she shows him how to activate the potential of Brain Burst, virtually accelerating their cognitive processes to the point at which time around them seems to stop. While in the accelerated mode, Kuroyukihime advises Haruyuki to let Araya's punch connect with him, knocking himself at her so that the school's cameras and nearby witnesses will catch Araya violently attacking them, ending Haruyuki's ridicule. Haruyuki complies which ends with Araya and his gang being detained by security. After school, as Haruyuki and Chiyuri head home, they meetup with Takumu Mayuzumi, Haruyuki's other childhood friend, but Haruyuki runs away after thinking that Chiyuri told Takumu about the delinquents. Later that night, Haruyuki has a nightmare of encountering delinquents and Chiyuri and Takumu pitying him which he wishes to fly free from his torment before waking up. Despite being told by Kuroyukihime not to connect to the globalnet, Haruyuki forgets and steps out of his home where he is transported into a war-torn world with a new robotic avatar body."

		 "Haruyuki starts to realize Brain Burst is in fact a VRMMO fighting game before he is defeated by another Burst Linker named Ash Roller. At lunch, Kuroyukihime explains to Haruyuki the rules of Brain Burst where Burst Linkers must duel each other in order to obtain Burst Points which can be expended for acceleration powers. She also explains that his Brain Burst avatar, Silver Crow, was created from his subconscious as a result of his inferiority complex. Despite Kuroyukihime offering him to return to his normal life, Haruyuki declines, wishing instead to help her since she helped him with the delinquents. After they log out, Kuroyukihime explains to some curious students about her and Haruyuki's relationship, claiming she confessed to him but he rejected her, much to the students surprise and Haruyuki's horror. After school, armed with new knowledge by Kuroyukihime, Haruyuki enters the Accelerated World to have a rematch with Ash Roller. Performing a surprise attack, Silver Crow runs to the top of a building, hoping to win by timeout since Ash Roller can't climb buildings due to his motorcycle. Although, Ash Roller, had upgraded his motorcycle to climb walls, manages to reach the top and repeatedly overruns Silver Crow. After suffering from his attacks, Silver Crow manages to figure out Ash Roller's weakness; his motorcycle's rear wheel drive. He then lifts the rear wheel off the ground, immobilizing Ash Roller and finishing him off with a headbutt, winning the duel whilst impressing the other spectating Burst Linkers. As Haruyuki logs out, he is congratulated by Kuroyukihome. Just then Chiyuri confronts Kuroyukihime, demanding to know if she is manipulating Haruyuki."

		 "Investigation",
		 "Kuroyukihime tells Chiyuri that she is dating Haru and drags him to a cafe. While there, Kuroyukihime explains her dilemma to Haru. Brain Burst was anonymously created seven years ago which allows acceleration only to those who were born with the neuro-linker. Therefore, all Burst Linkers are children age 15 and younger, allowing its existence to be concealed from the public. Kuroyukihime wants to meet the creator to learn the purpose of the program. To do that, she needs to reach level 10, which requires five wins over level 9 Burst Linkers and one defeat results in the permanent uninstallation of Brain Burst. Two years ago, Kuroyukihime was one of the Kings of Pure Color, a group of level 9 Burst Linkers that agreed to not fight each other, but she did not agree to the treaty and beheaded the Red King, causing her to be branded a traitor and leading her to seal away Black Lotus. Since then, she has stayed offline, only logging on to the school's local net with a dummy avatar. Recently, she was challenged to a duel by a Burst Linker named Cyan Pile, which could lead to her identity as Black Lotus being exposed. Thus, she must find Cyan Pile's identity. She suspects Chiyuri, which is why she provoked her, although Haru doubts it knowing that Chiyuri is bad at games. Haru begins the investigation by going to Chiyuri's home under the pretense of apologizing for lunch the other day. The two link up with each other with an extremely short cable and reconcile with each other, with Chiyuri letting Haru know that Takumu was not told about the ridicule. During the conversation, Haru discovers that while Chiyuri is not Cyan Pile, there is a back door connection that could lead to finding its identity."

When Haru is interviewed by a pair of gossip club students, they hint that Kuroyukihime legitimately likes him, which he refuses to believe. As Kuroyukihime and Haru walk together that day, Haru resigns himself to just being a pawn, prompting a slap from her. Just then, an out of control car (driven by a mad Araya) heads straight towards Haru and Kuroyukihime, prompting them to go into the Accel World. As Kuroyukihime confesses to Haru that she is in love with him, she uses a powerful move called Physical Full Burst, which causes her to lose nearly all of her Burst Points, allowing her to manipulate her body in the Accelerated World to push Haru out of the way of the car, leading to only her being hit. As Kuroyukihime is taken into intensive care, Haru comes to realize that if she was to be attacked by a Burst Linker now, she would be completely vulnerable, and so chooses to stay the night. As the morning comes, Haru spots Takumu coming into the hospital and comes to realize that he is the true Cyan Pile. With just a split second to act, Haru rushes to challenge Takumu to a Brain Burst match before he can challenge Kuroyukihime. "

Haru initially gets the advantage thanks to his speed, but is soon hit by Takumu's special attack and loses a foot as well. As Takumu vents his anger on how Chiyuri is always thinking about Haru, he hits him with a powerful attack that leaves him with a fraction of health. Haru finds himself in a basement where he finds Kuroyukihime's sleeping avatar, whose beating heart reminds him how strength isn't always about winning. Just then, Haru gains a new power in the form of wings, making him the first flying Brain Burst avatar and allowing him to fly back up and overcome Takumu's attack. In lieu of defeating Takumu, causing him to lose all his points and his Burst Linker status, Haru asks him to become one of his allies and start over. Afterwards, Kuroyukihime appears and decides to reveal her avatar's true form, Black Lotus, announcing her goals to the spectators. Everyone was shocked to see that Black Lotus is still alive. Later, as Haru visits Kuroyukihime in hospital, she tells him her real name (although it's censored)."

Haru earns enough points to upgrade to level 2, though in his haste, he upgrades too early and is left with a low amount of Burst Points as a result. Takumu offers to share some of his points with Haru, but he declines, saying it would take all the honor out of fighting. Afterwards, the two go over to Chiyuri's, where they eat ice cream together and explain to Chiyuri about Brain Burst. It is here where Takumu gets the idea to have Haru hire a bodyguard known as Aqua Current to protect him until he gets his points up. As Haru goes through the procedures to hire Current, he inadvertently discovers it is actually a girl. Haru discusses things with Current, and then Aqua Current arranges a battle with two Burst Linkers. Aqua helps Haru to defeat them. Afterwards, Haru gains Burst Points and Aqua erases his memory because he knows her real identity and vows to never meet him again. Takumu goes to the hospital to meet Kuroyukihime, who activates her Burst Link and challenges him to a duel, during which she confronts him, asks him why he left the ken-do club, and why he wants to forcibly uninstall the Brain Burst program. During this, Takumu realizes how much Haru admires him."

As Kuroyukihime teaches Takumu to stop feeling guilty and trust his friends more, Haru and Current manage to work together to win their match, getting his points back up to 54. Just then, Current challenges Haru to a match with the intention of taking all his points. As Haru shows he is still willing to believe in her and doesn't fight back, she reveals she was lying, telling him to treasure his friends before erasing his memory of her.

After Kuroyukihime explains to everyone about how she had fought the last Burst Linker who was possessed by the armor, Yuniko reveals that the current Chrome Disaster is from her own legion, explaining how she needs Haru's flight to get close enough to use an ability to instantly defeat him.

When asked, Kuroyukihime only replies that it is someone who betrayed her trust, also explaining how a relationship between guardian and protegé is different from others. Later that day, Haru, Kuroyukihime, Takumu and Yuniko gather together and enter the Unlimited Accel World to search for Chrome Disaster.

As Chrome Disaster attempts to escape the Unlimited Field, Silver Crow manages to counterstrike by using the wires that he uses for aerial maneuvering against him, defeating him in the process. Scarlet Rain then delivers the Judgement Blow, removing him from Brain Burst. Afterwards, Scarlet Rain laments how, after Cherry Rook had introduced her to Brain Burst, she became ignorant to his problems after achieving level 9, but Silver Crow is able to assure her that they could still be friends even outside of the Accelerated World. After checking that the Armor of Destruction was completely destroyed the group turns to log out. Silver Crow hears a faint echo but logs out, unaware that a fragment of the armor lynched onto his back. Later, Haruyuki once again finds Yuniko at his apartment, where she explains the reason Cherry Rook was so desperate to become stronger, because he was about to move in the real world and didn't want their bond in Brain Burst to be severed.

As Taker begins to fall, the wings merge with the Gale Thruster enabling Crow unlimited rapid air-speed which he further combines with his Laser Sword to deliver a final devastating blow to Dusk Taker. After the battle, Lime Bell reveals that her ability isn't healing but in fact, Time Reversal, which she used on Dusk Taker to revert him back to the state in which he didn't possess Crow's wings. She also reveals that she only stuck with Taker so that she could level up and wait for the right moment to use her ability. Reduced to nothing more than his torso, Taker begins pleading with the Black Legion and even Black Vice to spare him, or else he would reveal all of their information and the Acceleration Research Legion to the real world. Vice declines to help him and instead retreats, having no grudge against them and that Seiji's Brain Implant Chip would dissolve after Brain Burst is removed, tying up the loose ends. After Silver Crow delivers the final blow, Lime Bell reveals she informed Black Lotus of the events prior to their battle and officially joins Nega Nebulus. Back in the real world, as Kuroyukihime returns, Haruyuki gives her the full story and she tearfully embraces him, worried that she might have lost him and vows to stay by his side. She also clears Haruyuki's name at school whilst Seiji lost all memories pertaining to Brain Burst. After school the group along with Yuniko and Blood Leopard theorize about Brain Burst's effects on a person's memories after it is removed, concluding that they should reach Level 10 and ask its creator directly. Finally Kuroyukihime accompanies Haruyuki as he keeps true to his promise of returning Sky Raker's armament to her. Kuroyukihime tearfully calls out to Raker as she leaves wanting to repair their friendship and they run and embrace each other. At this point, they refer to each other by name, Sky Raker being Fuuko Kurasaki and Kuroyukihime being &quot;Sac-chan&quot;. Haruyuki concludes by saying that no matter what difficulties and changes lie ahead, humans will continue to accelerate forward. "
