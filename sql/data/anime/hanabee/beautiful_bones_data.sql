		 "The Princess Who Loves Bones",
		 "High school student Shotaro Tatewaki heads out of town with the eccentric osteologist Sakurako Kujo, who promises to buy him shrimp from the village. While digging around for bones, Shotaro ends up uncovering a human skull with a bashed-in frontal bone with an almost entirely intact Sphenoid bone. Against Sakurako's wishes, he calls the police, though she uses circumstantial evidence to prove that the skull is actually from around a century old. As the policeman escorts the two to the station, he lets slip a &quot;lovers&quot; double-suicide that also happened in the same village, and Sakurako begs him to let her see the bodies. While the local detective is quick to pronounce the cause of death as a lovers' suicide, Sakurako points out that the knot tied around the wrists and the lack of fluid inside the bodies prove that it was a homicide someone wanted to disguise as a suicide by the ocean. Despite her hard work, Shotaro catches Sakurako trying to sneak the original skull out of the police station, and makes her leave it on the way back home."

Shotaro gets closer to the location when his classmate Yuriko, who babysat for her, tells him where to find the house. Shotaro and Sakurako enter the house to find the dead body of the girl's mother, and deduce that someone she knew killed her, but are unsure why she let herself be stabbed in the kitchen. Sakurako finds a crawlspace underneath the mother's body, where the girl's baby brother lies unconscious. Sakurako performs CPR on the baby when the attacker, the father of the family, comes back to the house. After stabbing the policeman with a knife, he enters the house where Shotaro manages to subdue him, but Sakurako screams out the name &quot;Soutarou&quot; after being afraid of his safety.

		 "The Bones that Slumber in Summer",
		 "Sakurako drags Shotaro to a game trail at a nature park with the promise of tasty watermelon. A couple of backpackers stumble upon a dead body, and Sakurako immediately rushes to study it while Shotaro calls the police. After Sakurakou deduces that the death was several months old and could not have been a suicide judging by a break in the spine, she later explains to Shotaro that the Soutarou she mentioned was her younger brother who died long ago. The next day, Yuriko approaches Shotaro, revealing that the bones he found belonged to her grandmother, who the police believe committed suicide. The grandmother had been taking care of her grandfather, who was a good painter but had also gone senile and needed constant care at home. The next day, Sakurako returns to the cliff with Shotaro and his classmate to prove that the grandmother did not commit suicide, but that she had gone for a walk to view the sunrise from a high point, having only fallen by accident. Though saddened, the girl is glad to know that her grandmother didn't kill herself or willingly abandon her own grandfather. "

		 "The Cursed Man, Part 1",
		 "Sakurako and Shotaro are asked by Utsumi to help his friend Takeshi Fujioka, who believes himself to be cursed, as all the men in his family live short lives, and also possesses a supposedly cursed dog, whose owners had all died.

		 "The Cursed Man, Part 2",
		 "Sakurako discovers the painting Takeshi had kept in his study was painted with a pigment containing arsenic which, when combined with the mold that had grown from being kept in storage, had been releasing a deadly gas. She further deduces that the death of the other men in Takeshi's family was due to stress causing an abnormality in their coronary arteries. Just as the others seem to breathe a sigh of relief, Sakurako senses something is amiss about why Takeshi chose now to contact Utsumi. Finding Takeshi outside with his leg cut by an axe, Sakurako deduces that he had tried to commit suicide in a way that would look like an accident in order to escape his debt, though Miyuki yells at him that money is less important than family. With the ambulance delayed by an illegally parked vehicle, Utsumi carries Takeshi the rest of the way, allowing him to make it safely. Afterwards, as Sakurako takes Hector in with her, she becomes curious about the mysterious person who appraised Takeshi's painting. "
