		 "Adventurer (Bell Cranel)",
		 "Gods who created the Universe descended from Heaven to live among humans on the condition they swore to never again use their godly powers. The Gods only remaining power is the Blessing, which they grant to humans to level up their powers (Similar to how characters level up in video games). These humans, known as Familia, become that Gods family. Bell Cranel, the only Familia of the Goddess, Hestia, is almost killed by a Minotaur. He is saved by Ais Wallenstein, Familia of the Goddess Loki, and falls in love with her. Hestia realises he has gained the magical skill Learis Freese, which will raise his level rapidly based on the strength of his feelings as he fights, but decides to keep it secret as it makes him very valuable and other Gods may try to acquire him. The next day, after more adventuring, Bells stats rises dramatically. Bell plans on talking to Ais but he overhears another Familia talking about how he embarrassed himself fighting the Minotaur. Realising how pathetic he must seem compared to Ais he re-enters the dungeon, desperately slaying as many monsters as he can and returns to Hestia in the morning, beaten and bleeding."

Hephaistos forge an enchanted Tant≈ç for Bell. Bell is asked by the maids of the Hostess of Fertility Pub to return a purse to Syr, a waitress with a crush on Bell, who got so excited about the festival she forgot it.

The unnamed Goddess releases a captured albino gorilla monster, ordering it to capture Bell. It corners Hestia and Bell, who attacks it with his original knife only for it to shatter.
