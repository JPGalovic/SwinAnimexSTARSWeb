		 "In 2095, Tatsuya Shiba and his sister Miyuki enroll at the First Private Magic University Affiliated High School, but due to the difference in their grades in the practical exam, Miyuki is placed in the Course 1 curriculum with the other students who have demonstrated high magical skills, (informally known as &quot;Blooms&quot;) while Tatsuya, on the other hand, having scored poorly on the practical exam is assigned to the Course 2 curriculum (insultingly called &quot;Weeds&quot; by Course 1 students) even though he placed first in the theoretical exam. Tatsuya becomes acquainted with several Course 2 students including Erika Chiba, Leo Saijo and Mizuki Shibata. The chasm between the Weeds and Blooms leads to a confrontation when a number of Miyuki's classmates object to her hanging around with her brother and his new friends. Violence seems imminent but the magic sequence is disrupted by the student council president as she arrives with the chairman of the disciplinary committee."

		 "Tatsuya's skills and wits have earned him and his sister the scrutiny of Mayumi Saegusa, Student Council president and Mari Watanabe, leader of the Public Morals Committee. Mayumi invites Miyuki to join the Student Council as the first year representative but she initially declines and puts her brother's name forward. Upon learning that by school regulation, year representatives must be Course 1 students, she accepts. Not wanting to waste his talents, Mari proposes that Tatsuya be the Student Council's nominee for a vacant position on the Public Morals Committee, which President Saegusa agrees to. At a meeting later that day, Student Council vice-president Hanzo Gyoubushoujo Hattori opposes Tatsuya's nomination which prompts Miyuki to defend him. Hanzo reprimands her for her seeming bias towards her brother which causes Tatsuya to challenge him to a magic duel. Tatsuya easily defeats Hanzo, much to the surprise of the Student Council. "

Mari introduces Tatsuya to the other members of the Public Morals Committee, who note the fact that he's a Course 2 student, but warmly welcome him on learning of his victory over the previously undefeated Hanzo. To his dismay, Mari informs Tatsuya that Shun Morisaki, the Course 1 student who started the altercation on their first day, is also joining the Committee on a faculty recommendation. His first taste of action involves a confrontation between the kendo club and kenjutsu club. The head of the kenjutsu club, who combines magic with swordplay, forces Sayaka Mibu, a member of the kendo club and Weed, to spar. When he loses, he uses magic in a follow-up attack, in contravention of the rules. Tatsuya steps in and arrests him but is assaulted by the rest of the kenjutsu club who refuse to acknowledge his authority just because he is a Weed. "
