		 "Taichi Yaegashi, Iori Nagase, Himeko Inaba, Yui Kiriyama and Yoshifumi Aoki are first-year high school classmates and members of the Student Cultural Society. As Taichi, Iori and Himeko try to brainstorm about a new topic for a news article, Yoshifumi and Yui later arrive in the clubroom and claim to have temporarily switched bodies the previous night. Taichi, Iori and Himeko are pretty skeptical of this, but when Iori goes to a classroom to retrieve a notebook, it is soon proven to be real when Taichi suddenly switches bodies with Iori and briefly gets hit on by the class president, Maiko Fujishima. After spending the rest of the afternoon convincing Himeko what had happened is real, Taichi and Iori eventually switch back to their original bodies, before the five of them leave school to return to their homes."

		 "The next morning, Himeko, Yoshifumi and Yui all switch bodies together, though soon revert to normal. After the gang are excused from absence in class, Taichi briefly ends up switching places with Yui before getting grilled by Iori over what happened the previous day while he was in her body. Just then, the gang is approached by someone who had swapped bodies with their homeroom teacher Ryuzen Goto, calling himself Heartseed, who is revealed to be responsible for the body swapping, vaguely explaining the situation before leaving. A week later, the group discuss how best to handle the situation without making anyone else suspicious. As Iori later swaps bodies with Yoshifumi, she talks with Taichi about how the switching may affect their individuality before she switches back. The next day, as Taichi and Himeko switch and end up volunteering for off-campus cleaning duty with Maiko, Himeko decides to get revenge against Taichi and declare to Maiko that Iori is hers while in Taichi's body.

		 "As Taichi questions Himeko about what she said in front of Maiko, she implies to Taichi that he has feelings for Iori while also worrying about how the body swapping could eventually break them. Later, Taichi and Yoshifumi learn that Yui has androphobia, the fear of men. That night, as Taichi switches with Yui, they meet up in a park, where she reveals she gained that fear after almost being raped in middle school, believing there was no way she could beat a man in a fight. Wanting to help her get over her fear, Taichi teaches Yui that the crotch is the one weakness that all men possess. The next day, as Yui becomes a bit more confident and decides to take up martial arts again, Himeko suddenly collapses before Taichi. "

After dropping Himeko off, Iori tells Taichi about the troubles she faced due to her mother Reika Nagase constantly getting remarried, having to keep changing her persona to fit the tastes of others while eventually forgetting who she originally was, and she feels that the body swapping would cause her to just fade away. The next day, Taichi confronts Himeko, who eventually reveals that she cannot trust them to use another's body for evil deeds, hating herself for feeling that way. As Taichi tells Himeko she does not need to change who she is to be accepted by others, he tells her a secret that he has lustfully thought of her and the other girls in the past. Moved by his confession, Himeko decides to share her issues with the others and finds the others accept her."

		 "Yoshifumi once again confesses to Yui, but she declines since she is not ready to dating anyone just yet. Iori pretends to have swapped places with Himeko to find out how Taichi feels about her. After he says that he likes their current relationship, Himeko walks in on them, causing Iori to run off in embarrassment. Taichi realizes his folly and chases after her, finding her on a bridge over the river. Taichi expresses his admiration for her and confesses to her, but Heartseed suddenly possesses Iori and forces her to jump off into the river, which results for her to be hospitalized for intensive care. Heartseed, who then possesses Goto, tells the others that Iori will soon die, allotting them thirty minutes to decide amongst themselves whose soul will die with her and giving them the ability to switch bodies on verbal request. As Iori swaps with Yoshifumi and learns of the situation, she offers to die with her own body, not willing to sacrifice anyone else. As she spends time talking to everyone individually, she confesses to Taichi and kisses him while in Himeko's body. It turns out that Iori managed to survive and that Heartseed planned out this whole ordeal. As Iori recovers from her injuries and returns to school, the gang assume that the body swapping has stopped, while Himeko gets revenge on Taichi for stealing her first kiss."

Later that night, both Taichi and Iori end up doing things unconsciously, though it does give them a chance to finally talk about the confession. The next day, Taichi, Iori and Himeko learn from Maiko that Yui and Yoshifumi had been taken into police custody after Yui had beaten up some guys hitting on some girls, while Yoshifumi was trying to protect her from being taken away. As Taichi, Iori and Himeko discuss the voices they had been hearing in their heads, Heartseed appears again, explaining that they are being put through a new phenomenon in which their bodies will impulsively act on their deepest desires. As Taichi, Iori, Himeko and Yoshifumi discuss how they need to be more careful to try and not get innocent people involved, Himeko hides her doubt from the others.

Concerned about Iori, Yui later tries to reason with her, but Iori just responds that her changing personality means that she can no longer be friends with Yui. As Yui is approached by Heartseed that evening, she resolves to stop relying on others so much, later giving Taichi some encouragement to help save Iori.

After calming her down, Himeko tries to talk to Iori again by sharing an embarrassing dream about Taichi. Iori eventually breaks down, and due to all the stress and suffering the Heartseed incidents have caused her, she reveals how she cannot stand to keep up her fake, cheerful personality anymore.
