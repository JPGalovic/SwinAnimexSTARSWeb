		 "Hajime Ichinose is a rather eccentric schoolgirl who is obsessed with notebooks. One day, she is approached by a mysterious man named JJ who pulls out a journal called a NOTE from her body, declaring her to be the new member of the elusive Gatchaman team. She later follows the words appearing in her NOTE to the mall, where a Gatchaman named Sugane Tachibana manages to defeat an alien that had disguised itself as a human. Later that day, Sugane brings Hajime to the Gatchaman's hideout where she meets the other members, Joe Hibiki, OD, Utsutsu, and their leader, Paiman. Sugane explains that their duty is to protect Earth from a hostile alien race known as the MESS that has been abducting humans. Hajime and Sugane are soon called upon by JJ to fight a MESS at the bus station, during which Hajime transforms for the first time, whilst a mysterious figure watches. "

Later that day, Hajime teaches Sugane about a popular social app called GALAX, which allows users in the vicinity to help each other, and decides to take him to an offline meet-up. Later, as Hajime and Sugane are sent in to fight another MESS, Hajime chooses not to fight it but instead communicate with it, managing to befriend it.

The next day, GALAX users at Hajime and Sugane's school receive word from Rui, under the guise of X, that some spoiled milk has been sent to their school, prompting Hajime and the other students to try to get the word out. With help from Sugane, Hajime manages to warn the other students and shut down the vending machines distributing the milk. Later that day, when a helicopter crash puts some citizens on a gondola at risk, Rui approves the usage of something known as &quot;Crowds&quot; whilst Joe comes across a curious alien capable of assuming a human's form by kissing them.

Meanwhile, as Hajime and the others join another GALAX offline meeting, they come across a tunnel where the ceiling is collapsed and begin to help the wounded. With the situation being too much for them alone, Rui reluctantly permits the use of Crowds to help evacuate the citizens.
